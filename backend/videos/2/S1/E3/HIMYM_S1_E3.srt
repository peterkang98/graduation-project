00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:17,185
TED:
So there was this one night
before I met your mother,

2
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,220
when I really wanted
to go to the bar.

3
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,555
The bar...
big surprise.

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,424
You sure spent
a lot of time in bars.

5
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,626
TED:
Well, that's just
we did back then.

6
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,828
Me, Marshall and Lily,

7
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,397
Barney,

8
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,331
Robin--

9
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:32,566
we all used to hang out
at this one bar

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,734
called McClaren's.

11
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,303
But then, one night...

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,870
Why don't we go
to McClaren's?

13
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,139
Let's go to McClaren's.

14
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,074
You guys talking
to each other?

15
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,276
Nobody's listening?

16
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,377
What's wrong
with McClaren's?

17
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,446
McClaren's is bore-snore.

18
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,381
Ted, tonight
we're going to go out.

19
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,982
We're going to meet
some ladies.

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,918
It's going to be legendary.

21
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,453
Phone five.

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,124
TED:
I had no idea why I hung out
with Barney.

23
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,892
You didn't phone five, did you?

24
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,462
I know when you don't
phone five, Ted.

25
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,298
Come on. We always
to go to McClaren's.

26
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, 'cause McClaren's is fun.

27
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,303
McClaren's is this much fun.

28
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,973
What I'm offering is the chance
to have... this much fun.

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,375
See, you say that.

30
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,277
You say it's going to be
this much fun,

31
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,746
but most of the time it ends up
being this much fun.

32
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,314
This much fun is good.

33
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,015
It's safe. It's guaranteed.

34
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,184
This hand gesture thing

35
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,185
doesn't really
work on the phone, does it?

36
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,219
No, it doesn't.

37
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,187
( tires squealing )

38
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,621
Get in the cab.

39
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:28,889
Marshall, you, too.

40
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:29,957
Oh, I wish I could.

41
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,091
I think Lily and I
are just going to...

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,626
I understand.
Get in the cab.

43
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:33,827
Why can Marshall say no?

44
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,929
Uh, because
he's getting laid.

45
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,465
Consistently.

46
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,500
Ted, Ted, Ted...

47
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,134
right here.

48
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,570
You keep going
to the same bar.

49
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,904
You're in a rut.

50
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,206
And I am a rut-buster.

51
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,175
I'm going to bust your rut.

52
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,509
It's not a rut, okay?

53
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,311
It's a routine,
and I like it.

54
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:54,715
Ted, what's the first syllable
in "rut-tine"?

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,491
Peace out, suckers.

56
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,429
All right, so what's
this legendary plan?

57
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:10,364
First we've got to pick
someone up at the airport.

58
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:11,965
Okay, I'm out of here.
Estaban, doors.

59
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:12,866
( doors locking )

60
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,506
Okay, we just do
this one little thing,

61
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,541
and the rest
of the night is ours.

62
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,109
Why do you have
those suitcases,

63
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,344
and who are we
picking up?

64
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,778
I don't know.
Maybe her.

65
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,879
Or her.

66
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,947
( chuckles )

67
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,217
Wait, so when you said
you were going

68
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,584
to pick someone up
at the airport,

69
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,020
you meant you were going
to "pick someone up"

70
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,054
at the airport?

71
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,257
Scenario:

72
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,658
a couple of girls
fly into town

73
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,693
looking for a fun
weekend in NYC,

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,794
when the meet

75
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,696
two handsome
international
businessmen

76
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,666
just back from
a lucrative trip
to Japan.

77
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,700
Sample dialogue:

78
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,836
"You have a wheelie bag?

79
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,271
Well, I have
a wheelie bag."

80
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,805
You've got to be kidding me.

81
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:52,940
False.

82
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,174
Sidebar... tuck in your shirt.

83
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,543
You look sketchy.

84
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,710
I'm sketchy?

85
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,046
Trust me, it's going
to be legendary.

86
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,814
Don't say "legendary," okay?

87
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,284
You're too liberal
with the word "legendary."

88
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,118
We're building an igloo
in Central Park.

89
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,720
It's going to be legendary.

90
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,256
Snowsuit up!

91
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:12,092
Ted, Ted, Ted...
right here.

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,627
This is happening.

93
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,596
Now you can either put the
bags on the carousel now,

94
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:16,864
or you can listen
to me give you

95
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,865
a really long speech

96
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,700
convincing you to put
the bags on the carousel.

97
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,701
Your move.

98
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,538
Ted, since
the dawn of time--

99
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,407
mankind has
struggled...

100
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:30,344
That night, Marshall had
a ton of studying to do.

101
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,246
So Lily went out
with Robin--

102
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,682
who was new to New York
and looking for a friend.

103
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:38,486
I'm so glad we finally get
to hang out, just the two of us.
Yeah.

104
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,621
You sure you're okay giving up
your Friday night

105
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,890
to hang with an old,
almost married lady?

106
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:43,757
Oh, please.

107
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,793
I'm so sick of the
meat market scene.

108
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,060
Guys are like the subway.

109
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,196
You miss one, another one
comes along in five minutes.

110
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,566
Unless it's the end of the night
and then you get on anything.

111
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,401
Hey-oh!

112
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,704
Compliments of that guy.

113
00:03:58,806 --> 00:03:59,807
Really?

114
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,775
Sweet.

115
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:02,910
Oh, for you it's $6.

116
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,747
Oh, yes, that's one drawback
to being engaged.

117
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,516
I'm sure that's why
he didn't...

118
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,617
Hey.

119
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,352
Oh, hello.

120
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,859
So, uh... did you just
get in from Detroit?

121
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,631
Japan.

122
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,002
Okay, carousel 4
is tapped out.

123
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,105
Ready? Because I'm about
to drop some knowledge.

124
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:35,443
Cute girls are not
from Buffalo.

125
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,145
Time-out, 10:00.

126
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,380
You ready to rock this, Tedder?

127
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,681
All right,
I think we need

128
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,483
to refine our
back story first.
How did we...?

129
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,017
Ted, you klutzy
great guy you.

130
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,256
Hey, I'm Barney.

131
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,891
Hi.
My God, are you okay?

132
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,426
I am so sorry.

133
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,294
It's fine. No, you were
shaky on your landing.

134
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,796
I give you a 9.2.

135
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,030
Ooh.

136
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,031
Hi. I'm Ted.

137
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:58,966
I'm Laura.

138
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,701
Look, I'm really sorry
that we have to hit and run,

139
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,135
but we've got
a plane to catch.

140
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,537
Where you headed?
Philadelphia.

141
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,906
Philly? That's where
we're headed.

142
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:06,674
You are?

143
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,810
Well, then we'll
see you on the plane.

144
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,844
Yes, you will.

145
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,247
Follow them.
Ticket's on me.

146
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,983
No. Barney!

147
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,719
Don't you get on that escalator!

148
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,390
And don't you dare get
on that subsequent escalator!

149
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:31,399
( drawling ):
Studying law.

150
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:37,438
* Making a responsible
choice for my future *

151
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:41,542
* On Friday night *

152
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:44,311
* Being a lawyer
had better be awesome. *

153
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,347
( phone ringing )

154
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,385
Whazzup, Ted?

155
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,786
Are you all right?

156
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,154
Yeah.

157
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,355
Hey, guess
where I am.

158
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,990
I'm on a... ready?
plane to... ready?

159
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:57,991
Philadelphia.

160
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,060
That is awesome.

161
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,261
Hey, is that Marshall?

162
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,763
Marshall, stop
whatever you're doing,

163
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,164
get in that hoopty-ass
Fiero of yours

164
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,399
and come meet us
in Philly.

165
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,434
It's going to be legendary.

166
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,402
Man, I wish I could, guys...

167
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,537
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

168
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,071
I sent you some pictures
on my phone. Check it.

169
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,679
Philly.

170
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,981
Admit it:
you're having fun.

171
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,583
This much fu...

172
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,118
35,000 feet of fun.

173
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,654
Well, I didn't think
I'd be flying
to Philadelphia

174
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,255
when I woke up this morning,
I'll give you that.

175
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,322
Attaboy.

176
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,258
Let's go talk
to those girls.

177
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,560
Whoa, whoa, the
seat belt sign's on.

178
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:36,564
Ted, you've been living
your whole life in a seat belt.

179
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,666
It's time to unclick.

180
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,437
Sir, the seat belt
light's on.

181
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,138
Yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

182
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,109
Well, I grew up
in Park Slope.

183
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,143
Oh, I love Park Slope.

184
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,378
When did you move
to Manhattan?

185
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,946
You're from Park Slope?

186
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:53,981
Uh, no, she is.

187
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,883
So where are you from?

188
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,485
Heaven?

189
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,453
Yeah, I'm a ghost.

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,189
I died 15 years ago,
like that pickup line.

191
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,156
Hey-oh!

192
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:05,826
God, I'm so sorry.

193
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,461
Oh, believe me,
I've been there.

194
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,229
I have this line
that I use
when guys come...

195
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,197
Check it out.

196
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,466
Hey...

197
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,602
You take this one.

198
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,505
I'll save it
for the next one.

199
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,339
( chuckles )

200
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,774
So what brings
you guys to Philly?

201
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,109
We're visiting
our boyfriends.

202
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,945
I think hers is going
to propose this weekend.

203
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,446
Isn't that great?

204
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:29,717
So great.

205
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,490
So there we were:

206
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,391
stuck on an airplane
to Philadelphia

207
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,594
with two very un-single girls,

208
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,262
all thanks
to your Uncle Barney.

209
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,363
Aren't they cute?

210
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,432
They're both linebackers
for the Eagles.

211
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,300
( coughs )
Both?

212
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,269
Both of their boyfriends

213
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,971
are linebackers.

214
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,708
You're going to Philly?
Why?

215
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,409
( clearing throat )

216
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,111
I didn't ask.

217
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,749
Well, it's sounds like you're
having a lot more fun than I am.

218
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,617
I'm just talking
to guys backs

219
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,185
while they hit on Robin.

220
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,354
Yeah, I bet she gets that a lot.

221
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,356
Don't you bet
I get that a lot?

222
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,291
Not with a ring
on your finger.

223
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,760
I mean, you know,
guys see the ring,

224
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,295
it's like ka-chong,
Marshall parking only.

225
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,530
Oh, of course.

226
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,898
That's it, the ring.

227
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,800
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

228
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,068
Oh, it's totally the ring.

229
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,803
If you took that ring
off your finger,

230
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,338
you'd have a ton of guys
crowding your junk.

231
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,707
I'm not gonna take off my ring.

232
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,041
Wouldn't you be jealous

233
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,711
of guys swarming
all over my beeswax?

234
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,780
Oh, yeah, you know me--

235
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,414
I'm the jealous type.

236
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,216
Any goon so much as looks
at you,

237
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,685
I'll sock him in the kisser.

238
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,286
No. Seriously, you girls have
a good time tonight.

239
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,288
Bye.

240
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,896
Robin!

241
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,164
Robin!

242
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,233
Hey, I'm over here.

243
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,904
* G-G-Goin' to Philly! *

244
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,438
Marshall, don't
come to Philly.

245
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,674
But we're on an adventure.

246
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,509
We're on a tarmac
in Philadelphia.

247
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,444
Crazy...
adventure.

248
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,814
Fine.

249
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,650
No! No!

250
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,218
The night has just started.

251
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,720
Look, airport bar.

252
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,154
Flight attendants.

253
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,456
They'll get your tray table
in its full upright position.

254
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,125
Say what?!

255
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,461
Passengers Mosby and Stenson,
please come with us, gentlemen.

256
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,263
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

257
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,432
Barney, I am going
to kill you.

258
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,900
Don't say
you're gonna kill someone

259
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,636
in front of airport security.

260
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,004
Not cool, not cool.

261
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,708
This is an outrage!

262
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,844
We are international
businessmen

263
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,579
on very important
international
business trip.

264
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:41,915
I demand you release
us immediately!

265
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,784
You demand?!
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,918
He does not demand.

267
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,286
We-We-We-We have no demands.

268
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,421
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to remain calm.

269
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,522
Okay. Yeah, I'm calm.

270
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,458
I'm totally calm.

271
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,126
We've got footage of you
placing two bags

272
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,128
on JFK carousel 3,

273
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,596
and abandoning them

274
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,466
to purchase a last-minute flight
with cash.

275
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,234
Those bags were your
responsibility.

276
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,269
They were your bags!

277
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,136
Sir, please.

278
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,537
We're assessing

279
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,573
the bag situation.

280
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,842
( crackling whirring )

281
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,578
Look, this is all just...

282
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:12,946
It's a misunderstanding.

283
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,848
Please.

284
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,317
We are international
businessmen.

285
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,420
My colleague accidentally
left the bags there.

286
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,055
Now, please let us go

287
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,558
before we miss
our international
business meeting.

288
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,761
Can't remember the last time

289
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,362
I saw an international
businessman

290
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,831
with an untucked shirt.

291
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,333
In addition,
we received

292
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,970
this footage
taken over the
last few months.

293
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,565
Believe it or not, that
duffel bag thing worked.

294
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,235
The truth is, my friend--

295
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,537
he does this thing
where he goes to airports

296
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,239
with fake luggage
to pick up girls,

297
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,241
and we followed some here
to Philadelphia.

298
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,343
That-That-That's it.
That's all this is.

299
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,212
Nobody's that lame.

300
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,348
Yes, he's that lame.

301
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,316
Tell him you're that lame.

302
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,087
We are international
businessmen.

303
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,421
Oh, come on!

304
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,290
Sir, lower your
voice, or I will

305
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,358
restrain you.

306
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,961
Dude, seriously,
relax.

307
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,029
We at least get
to call our lawyer.

308
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,331
Exactly!

309
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,399
We have a lawyer?

310
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,736
Listen to me--
you're both American citizens.

311
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,772
Don't let him pull
any Patriot Act voodoo.

312
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,073
You both retain the right

313
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,640
to refuse
to answer any questions

314
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,909
without an attorney present,

315
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,178
so don't say anything
until I get there, all right?

316
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,445
Okay. Good-bye.

317
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,847
* Philly! *

318
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,383
* The adventure continues *

319
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,986
* Destroy! *

320
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,558
It's ridiculous
in here.

321
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,527
Why don't we go
somewhere else?

322
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:10,798
No, this place is great.

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,467
What are you doing?

324
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,103
What?

325
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,704
With your lips
and everything?

326
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:20,373
My lips are always like this.

327
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,820
You had to play
the race card.

328
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,754
Oh, relax, Ted.

329
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,056
We didn't do
anything wrong.

330
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,826
And, B.T.W., we'd be
out of here by now

331
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,228
if you had tucked in
your shirt.

332
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,162
Go ahead, JFK.

333
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,696
What is the baggage
status?

334
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,032
They're clean.

335
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,234
It's just a whole bunch
of condoms.

336
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,969
And a PowerBar.

337
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,005
You're free
to go.

338
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,875
TED:
Don't come to Philly.

339
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,076
Man, I'm almost halfway there.

340
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,410
Yeah, we just got released

341
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,546
and we're heading back
on the next flight.

342
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,747
Uh, meet us at McClaren's.

343
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,415
Maybe we can still make
last call.

344
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,650
Can't we just, just...

345
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,352
No, we can't just.
We're going home.

346
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,954
We're going to Sasha's.

347
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,688
Who the hell is Sasha?

348
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,290
Sasha.

349
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,060
She's having friends over
for drinks at her house.

350
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,395
It's gonna be legen...
wait for it--

351
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,330
and I hope you're not
lactose-intolerant

352
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,499
'cause the second half
of that word is... dary!

353
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,600
No.

354
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,668
Legendary.

355
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,670
Legendary. That sounds awesome.

356
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,072
No, Marshall, we're going back.

357
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,740
Fine.
Hold on. I have another call.

358
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,708
( beep )

359
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,877
Hello?

360
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,378
Marshall, we're
going to Sasha's.

361
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,779
No, we're not.

362
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,614
Ted, Ted, Ted.
Right here.

363
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,648
Yes, we are.

364
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,716
( beep )

365
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,219
Sorry, buddy--
two against one.

366
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,855
Ooh, look,
a booth opened up.

367
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,523
Really?

368
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,624
Yeah, I thought
we could

369
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,525
finally go talk...
and you're not

370
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,727
listening to me, so I'm
going to walk away.

371
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:48,996
Yeah, yeah, booth.

372
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,601
Hey.

373
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,602
Hey.

374
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,470
I'm engaged.

375
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,371
Yeah, I'm sorry.

376
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,706
I took my ring off.

377
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,074
It's very, very sweet of you

378
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,643
to come over and talk to me,
but I just...

379
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,078
Yeah, I'm gay.

380
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,546
I just came over
to let you know

381
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,281
that you sat on a grape.

382
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,020
Oh, damn it.

383
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,092
TED:
So Barney and I hit the town.

384
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,760
Philadelphia, PA.

385
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,696
Our first and only stop:
Sasha's party.

386
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,333
( TV blaring )

387
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,702
So, uh...

388
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,338
you're Sasha's friends, huh?

389
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,206
You know it.

390
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,876
( whispering ):
You guys, keep
the volume down.

391
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,979
You're gonna wake
my grandpa.

392
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,316
Who wants hard lemonade?

393
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:51,992
Philly!

394
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,628
Shh!
( softly ):
Philly.

395
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,902
Back at the bar,
girls' night out

396
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,237
wasn't going
as Robin had hoped.

397
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,673
( cell phone ringing )

398
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,544
Lily's phone.

399
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,446
Robin, uh, where's Lily?

400
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,148
She's, uh...

401
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,850
Is she talking to some hot guy?

402
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,252
Oh, you can tell me.

403
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,920
It's totally cool.
It was my idea.

404
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,922
Hell, I told her
she could take the ring off.

405
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,057
Really?

406
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,492
Well, I thought
it was kind of weird,

407
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,327
but if you're cool with it,
yeah, uh, it's off,

408
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,661
and she's talking to some guy.

409
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,997
Do you want me to go over and...

410
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,531
No, don't interrupt.

411
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,233
It's awesome.

412
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,069
So, the ring's really off, huh?

413
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,339
It's awesome.

414
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,841
Well, just tell her I called.

415
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:46,313
And tell her that
she is... awesome.

416
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,454
* Really, really awesome *

417
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:59,626
( weakly ):
* Our relationship
is built on mutual trust *

418
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,996
I can't breathe.

419
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,031
( laughing )

420
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,198
You hear that, Ted?

421
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,600
Dana works security
at the Liberty Bell.

422
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,036
I do okay.

423
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,538
Wow, it must be really well
cordoned off over there.

424
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,074
Do you ever go behind
the rope and touch it?

425
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,009
Only all the time.

426
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,211
You ever, like, stick
your head inside it?

427
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,779
Yeah.

428
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,681
You ever lick it?

429
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,950
Nope.

430
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,685
I have never licked it.

431
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,320
Hmm.

432
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:31,124
I bet nobody in history has
ever licked the Liberty Bell.

433
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,027
If someone were
to pull that off,

434
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:37,564
I dare say it would be...
what's the word?

435
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,998
Well, this is my stop.

436
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,133
Legendary.

437
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,401
Ted, legendary.

438
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,103
Barney, I'm going
to the airport.

439
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,371
Sasha, thank you,
and, uh,

440
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,405
tell your grandpa I'm sorry

441
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,639
I walked in on him
in the bathroom.

442
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,744
I'll get some club soda
for that stain.

443
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,816
Lily, I thought tonight
was about us hanging out.

444
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:57,884
What are you doing?

445
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,155
Just fending off the advances
of that totally hot guy.

446
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,790
Dude, I think that guy is gay.

447
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,658
Oh, I know
that guy is gay.

448
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,928
It's just, Marshall and I have
been together for nine years.

449
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,131
I haven't been single
since high school.

450
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,565
You want to be single?

451
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,001
You want to fight off
loser guys all night?

452
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,536
Does that seem like fun to you?

453
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,272
I guess I just wanted to throw
this net back into the ocean

454
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,774
and see how many fish
I could catch.

455
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,576
So far, one.

456
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,778
One gay dolphin.

457
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,046
And Marshall.

458
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,182
Lily, all these
girls here tonight

459
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,017
are all hoping to catch
what you've already got.

460
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,121
You're right. I know.

461
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,456
Hey, do you want
to go get coffee

462
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,358
and have an actual conversation?

463
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,694
If by "coffee"
you mean "cheesecake," then yes.

464
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,030
Hey, I got that club soda.

465
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,398
Let's see that booty.

466
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,667
Oh, thank you
so much.

467
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,140
You want to mess, pal?

468
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,775
That's my fiancÃ©e's hot backside
that you're dabbing.

469
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,310
Marshall, no.

470
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:59,479
Baby, please, don't ever
take that ring off again,

471
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,581
no matter how awesome
I say that it is.

472
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,350
It's okay, man...
Back off, hombre!

473
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,017
I'm not that afraid
to fight you.

474
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,018
You want to test

475
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,655
this guy, be my guest,
come on.

476
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,290
Marshall,
he's gay.

477
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:13,193
Oh, thank God. I've never
been in a fight before.

478
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,194
You don't say.

479
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,296
TED:
So, it turned out

480
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,531
Uncle Marshall
really was the jealous type.

481
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,333
Unfortunately,
that guy's boyfriend--

482
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,735
also the jealous type.

483
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,538
Hey!

484
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:35,915
Could have licked
the Liberty Bell.

485
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,985
We're going
to the airport.

486
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,654
Bong...

487
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:45,124
bong... bo...

488
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,160
Why do I hang out
with you? Why?

489
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,296
All I wanted was
to have a regular beer

490
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,331
at my regular bar
with my regular friends

491
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,899
in my regular city.

492
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,867
Ted, Ted, Ted.

493
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,803
You're not even looking.

494
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,705
No, I'm not.

495
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:03,410
Look, our forefathers died for
the pursuit of happiness, okay?

496
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,078
Not for the sit around
and wait of happiness.

497
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,747
Now, if you want,

498
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,149
you can go to the same bar,
drink the same beer,

499
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,551
talk to the same people
every day,

500
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,554
or you can lick
the Liberty Bell.

501
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:20,227
You can grab life by the crack
and lick the crap out of it.

502
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,563
That was
beautiful, man.

503
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,299
Thanks, Leonard.

504
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,302
Ted, you're missing out
on a valuable life lesson here.

505
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,904
Look, I don't need you
to teach me how to live, okay?

506
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,105
I know how to live.

507
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,041
If you want to go
lick the Liberty Bell,

508
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,175
just go lick it yourself.

509
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,278
No, it has to be
the two of us.

510
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,746
Why? Why do you
need me?

511
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,548
Because you're
my best friend, all right?

512
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,016
You don't have
to tell me I'm yours,

513
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,253
but the way I see it,
we're a team.

514
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,055
Without you, I'm...

515
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,991
I'm just the Dynamic Uno.

516
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,662
So, fine, if you
want to go home,

517
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,731
then we'll go home.

518
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,733
( sighs )

519
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,436
Fine.

520
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,838
We'll go lick the Liberty Bell.

521
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,307
Good 'cause we're here.

522
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,910
I had no idea how Barney

523
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,179
redirected the cab
without me knowing,

524
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,515
but we got out, Dana let us in,

525
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,517
and by God,
we licked the Liberty Bell.

526
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,985
You know what it tastes like?

527
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:19,919
What?

528
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,755
Freedom.

529
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,892
No, actually, it tastes
like pennies.

530
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,159
Oh, my God.

531
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,028
Did you guys really do that?

532
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,563
We really did.

533
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,800
And that was when I realized
why I hung out with Barney.

534
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,269
I never got where I thought
I wanted to go,

535
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,605
but I always got a great story.

536
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,710
So, that girl
you were talking to--

537
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,777
that was Mom?

538
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,546
Kids, every story
in a man's life

539
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,981
is like a dot
in an Impressionist painting...

540
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,417
So that's a no?

541
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,185
Yeah, that's a no.

542
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,854
( kids sighing )
What?! Come on...!
