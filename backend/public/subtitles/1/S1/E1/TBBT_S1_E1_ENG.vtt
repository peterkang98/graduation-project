00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.462
So if a photon is directed
through a plane with two slits in it

2
00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:08.156
and either slit is observed,
it will not go through both slits.

3
00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:09.454
If it's unobserved, it will.

4
00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.735
However, if it's observed
after it's left the plane

5
00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:14.689
but before it hits its target,
it won't have gone through both slits.

6
00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:16.862
Agreed.
What's your point?

7
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.240
There's no point, I just think
it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

8
00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.346
- Excuse me.
- Hang on.

9
00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.342
One across is "Aegean."

10
00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:34.859
Eight down is "Nabokov."

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.332
26 across is "MCM."

12
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.900
14 down is...
Move your finger...

13
00:00:40.787 --> 00:00:43.411
"Phylum" which makes 14 across
"Port-au-Prince"

14
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:48.276
See, "Papa Doc's capitol idea,"
that's "Port-au-Prince."

15
00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:50.777
Haiti.

16
00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.871
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

17
00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.726
Is this the high-IQ sperm bank?

18
00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.288
If you have to ask,
maybe you shouldn't be here.

19
00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.039
I think this is the place.

20
00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:09.766
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:11.927
- We'll be right back.
- Take your time.

22
00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.278
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

23
00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.850
Oh, wait.

24
00:01:28.028 --> 00:01:30.065
Leonard, I don't think I can do this.

25
00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:32.599
What, are you kidding?
You're a semi-pro.

26
00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:36.109
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

27
00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:39.438
There's no guarantee that our sperm
is going to generate high-IQ offspring.

28
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.462
Think about that. I have a sister with
the same basic DNA mix

29
00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:44.049
who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

30
00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.326
Sheldon, this was your idea.

31
00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:50.677
A little extra money to get fractional
T-1 bandwidth in the apartment.

32
00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.655
I know, and I do yearn
for faster downloads.

33
00:01:54.843 --> 00:01:57.655
But there's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

34
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:00.609
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use

35
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:04.276
an integral or a differential
to solve the area under a curve?

36
00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.667
- I'm sure she'll still love him.
- I wouldn't.

37
00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.335
Well, what do you want to do?

38
00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:12.457
I want to leave.

39
00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:15.594
What's the protocol for leaving?

40
00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:19.187
I don't know... I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

41
00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:22.176
Let's try just walking out.

42
00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:36.555
- Bye.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

43
00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:41.251
Are you still mad about the sperm bank?

44
00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:46.559
You want to hear an interesting
thing about stairs?

45
00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.079
Not really.

46
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.655
If the height of a single step
is off by as little as two millimeters,

47
00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.114
- most people will trip.
- I don't care.

48
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.792
Two milli... That doesn't seem right.

49
00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.330
No, it's true, I did a series of
experiments when I was 12.

50
00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:01.981
My father broke his clavicle.

51
00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.259
Is that why they sent
you to boarding school?

52
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.053
No. That was a result
of my work with lasers.

53
00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:15.091
New neighbor?

54
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.310
Evidently.

55
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:19.386
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

56
00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:22.570
200-pound transvestite
with a skin condition?

57
00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.699
Yes, she is.

58
00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.078
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

59
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:35.175
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

60
00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.098
Oh, that's nice.

61
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.092
We don't live together. I mean...

62
00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:41.892
We live together,

63
00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:44.992
but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.

64
00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:47.424
Okay, well...

65
00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:49.485
Guess I'm your new neighbor. Penny.

66
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.530
- Leonard. Sheldon.
- Hi.

67
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:57.110
Well...

68
00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.328
Welcome to the building.

69
00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:01.924
Thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

70
00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:03.850
Great.

71
00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:09.137
- Well... bye.
- Bye.

72
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.846
Should we have invited her for lunch?

73
00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:17.918
We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

74
00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.525
We already watched the season two DVDs.

75
00:04:20.647 --> 00:04:21.820
Not with commentary.

76
00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:26.457
I think we should be good neighbors

77
00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:28.464
and invite her over,
make her feel welcome.

78
00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.645
We never invited
Louie-slash-Louise over.

79
00:04:32.858 --> 00:04:34.499
And that was wrong of us.

80
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:36.069
We need to widen our circle.

81
00:04:36.474 --> 00:04:38.606
I have a very wide circle.

82
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.537
I have 212 friends on MySpace.

83
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:45.664
Yes, and you've never met one of them.

84
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.763
That's the beauty of it.

85
00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:51.777
I'm gonna invite her over.

86
00:04:52.278 --> 00:04:54.848
We'll have a nice meal and... chat.

87
00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:57.805
Chat? We don't chat.
At least not offline.

88
00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.513
It's not difficult.

89
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.153
You just listen to what she says

90
00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:06.093
and then you say something
appropriate in response.

91
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.490
To what end?

92
00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:12.076
Hi... again.

93
00:05:12.198 --> 00:05:14.071
Hi.

94
00:05:15.354 --> 00:05:16.379
Anyway...

95
00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:18.470
We brought home Indian food.

96
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.490
And...

97
00:05:21.013 --> 00:05:23.187
I know that moving can be stressful,

98
00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:25.489
and I find that
when I'm undergoing stress,

99
00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:28.768
that good food and company
can have a comforting effect.

100
00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:33.130
Also, curry is a natural laxative,
and I don't have to tell you

101
00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:35.884
that, you know, a clean colon is just...

102
00:05:36.207 --> 00:05:37.998
one less thing to worry about.

103
00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.600
I'm no expert, but I believe
in the context of a luncheon invitation,

104
00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:45.189
you might want to skip the
reference to bowel movements.

105
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.550
You're inviting me over to eat?

106
00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.930
Oh, that's so nice.
I'd love to.

107
00:05:52.107 --> 00:05:53.107
Great.

108
00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:55.605
So, what do you guys do
for fun around here?

109
00:05:56.396 --> 00:05:58.227
Today we tried masturbating for money.

110
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.871
Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state

111
00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.858
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started... Wait!

112
00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:11.045
The Earth began to cool

113
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.960
The autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools

114
00:06:13.985 --> 00:06:15.896
We built a wall,
we built the pyramids

115
00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:18.748
Math, science, history,
unraveling the mystery

116
00:06:18.784 --> 00:06:20.984
That all started with the big bang!

117
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:27.469
S01 E01

118
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:31.594
Okay, well,
make yourself at home.

119
00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:33.189
Okay. Thank you.

120
00:06:33.514 --> 00:06:34.648
You're very welcome.

121
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.720
This looks like some serious stuff.

122
00:06:40.842 --> 00:06:43.910
- Leonard, did you do this?
- Actually, that's my work.

123
00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:48.353
Yeah. Well, it's just
some quantum mechanics

124
00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:50.691
with a little string theory
doodling around the edges.

125
00:06:50.813 --> 00:06:52.310
That part there, that's just a joke.

126
00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:55.303
It's a spoof of the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

127
00:06:56.728 --> 00:07:00.049
So you're like one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

128
00:07:03.807 --> 00:07:06.061
- This is really impressive.
- I have a board.

129
00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:08.260
If you like boards, this is my board.

130
00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:10.613
Holy smokes.

131
00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:12.198
If by "holy smokes", you mean

132
00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:14.182
a derivative restatement
of the kind of stuff

133
00:07:14.332 --> 00:07:17.369
you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT, sure.

134
00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:19.583
- What?
- Come on.

135
00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:23.313
Who hasn't seen this differential
below "Here I sit, broken-hearted"?

136
00:07:23.707 --> 00:07:26.237
At least I didn't have
to invent 26 dimensions

137
00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:27.627
just to make the math come out.

138
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.200
I didn't invent them. They're there.

139
00:07:29.322 --> 00:07:32.442
- In what universe?
- In all of them... that is the point.

140
00:07:33.474 --> 00:07:34.882
Do you guys mind if I start?

141
00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:36.483
Penny...

142
00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:38.617
that's where l sit.

143
00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:41.781
So, sit next to me.

144
00:07:43.604 --> 00:07:45.025
No... I sit there.

145
00:07:46.677 --> 00:07:47.688
What's the difference?

146
00:07:47.824 --> 00:07:49.889
- What's the difference?
- Here we go.

147
00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:52.894
In the winter, that seat is
close enough to the radiator

148
00:07:53.017 --> 00:07:55.963
to remain warm, and yet not so
close as to cause perspiration

149
00:07:56.113 --> 00:07:58.478
In the summer, it's directly
in the path of a cross-breeze

150
00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:00.543
created by opening
windows there and there.

151
00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:02.286
It faces the television at an angle

152
00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.845
that is neither direct,
thus discouraging conversation,

153
00:08:05.005 --> 00:08:07.413
nor so far wide as to create
a parallax distortion.

154
00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:10.747
I could go on, but I think
I've made my point.

155
00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.301
Do you want me to move?

156
00:08:15.438 --> 00:08:17.337
- Well...
- Just sit somewhere else.

157
00:08:19.613 --> 00:08:20.613
Fine.

158
00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:39.903
Sheldon, sit!

159
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:46.855
Well, this is nice.

160
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.652
We don't have a lot of company over.

161
00:08:48.775 --> 00:08:51.490
That's not true. Koothrappali
and Wolowitz come over all the time.

162
00:08:51.613 --> 00:08:53.007
- I know, but...
- Tuesday night,

163
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.866
we played Klingon Boggle
till 1:00 a.m.

164
00:08:54.988 --> 00:08:55.994
Yeah, I remember.

165
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.955
- Don't say we don't have company.
- Sorry.

166
00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.985
- That has negative social implications.
- I said I'm sorry!

167
00:09:02.132 --> 00:09:03.132
So...

168
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:04.593
Klingon Boggle?

169
00:09:05.026 --> 00:09:07.349
Yeah. It's like regular Boggle, but...

170
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.625
in Klingon.

171
00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:14.942
That's probably enough about us.
So, tell us about you.

172
00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:17.062
Me? Okay.

173
00:09:17.553 --> 00:09:18.897
I'm a Sagittarius,

174
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.334
which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

175
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:24.628
Yes. It tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion

176
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.034
that the sun's apparent position

177
00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:29.096
relative to arbitrarily defined
constellations at the time of your birth

178
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:31.039
somehow affects your personality.

179
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.133
Participate in the what?

180
00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:37.526
I think
what Sheldon's trying to say

181
00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:40.547
is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

182
00:09:41.012 --> 00:09:43.198
Yeah, a lot of people
think I'm a water sign.

183
00:09:43.963 --> 00:09:45.778
Okay, let's see, what else.

184
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.936
I'm a vegetarian.
Except for fish.

185
00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:50.108
And the occasional steak. I love steak!

186
00:09:52.754 --> 00:09:53.833
Well, that's interesting.

187
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:55.984
Leonard can't process corn.

188
00:10:00.268 --> 00:10:02.523
Well... do you have some sort of a job?

189
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.716
I'm a waitress
at The Cheesecake Factory.

190
00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:07.577
I love cheesecake.

191
00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:08.756
You're lactose-intolerant.

192
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.317
I don't eat it...
I just think it's a good idea.

193
00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:14.756
Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.

194
00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:17.953
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska,

195
00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:21.599
to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.

196
00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:24.988
So, it's based on your life.

197
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.263
No, I'm from Omaha.

198
00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:32.572
If that was a movie,
I would go see it.

199
00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:33.733
I know, right?

200
00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:36.037
Okay, let's see, what else...

201
00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:39.105
Guess that's about it.

202
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:41.110
That's the story of Penny.

203
00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:43.806
It sounds wonderful.

204
00:10:45.176 --> 00:10:46.176
It was.

205
00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.267
Until I fell in love with a jerk!

206
00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:54.091
What's happening?

207
00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:59.404
God, you know,
4 years I lived with him.

208
00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.474
4 years... that's like
as long as high school.

209
00:11:02.596 --> 00:11:04.605
It took you 4 years
to get through high school?

210
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.094
It just... I can't believe
I trusted him.

211
00:11:15.044 --> 00:11:17.654
Should I say something?
I feel like I should say something.

212
00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.472
You? No, you'll only make it worse.

213
00:11:19.623 --> 00:11:21.748
You want to know the most pathetic part?

214
00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:24.912
Even though I hate
his lying, cheating guts...

215
00:11:25.636 --> 00:11:27.174
I still love him.

216
00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:29.199
Is that crazy?

217
00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:35.173
No, it's not crazy. It's a...

218
00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:37.622
It's a paradox.

219
00:11:37.877 --> 00:11:41.376
Paradoxes are part of nature.
Think about light.

220
00:11:41.498 --> 00:11:43.972
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave,

221
00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:45.931
as confirmed
by the double-slit experiments,

222
00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:48.351
but then along comes Albert Einstein

223
00:11:48.473 --> 00:11:51.728
and discovers that light
behaves like particles, too.

224
00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:55.973
Well, I didn't make it worse.

225
00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:00.396
I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.

226
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.952
On top of everything else,
I'm all gross from moving

227
00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:04.661
and my stupid shower doesn't even work.

228
00:12:04.783 --> 00:12:05.849
Our shower works.

229
00:12:07.692 --> 00:12:09.644
Really? Would it be totally
weird if I used it?

230
00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:10.996
- Yes.
- No.

231
00:12:13.962 --> 00:12:15.339
It's right down the hall.

232
00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:16.619
Thanks.

233
00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:18.313
You guys are really sweet.

234
00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:27.474
Well, this is an
interesting development.

235
00:12:30.511 --> 00:12:31.511
How so?

236
00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:33.820
It has been some time
since we've had a woman

237
00:12:33.942 --> 00:12:35.623
take her clothes off in our apartment.

238
00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:38.246
That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving,

239
00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:40.803
my grandmother with Alzheimer's
had that episode?

240
00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:44.611
Point taken.
It has been some time

241
00:12:44.734 --> 00:12:46.579
since we've had a woman
take her clothes off,

242
00:12:46.702 --> 00:12:49.028
after which we didn't
want to rip our eyes out.

243
00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:53.316
The worst part was watching
her carve that turkey.

244
00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:57.212
So what exactly are you
trying to accomplish here?

245
00:12:58.148 --> 00:12:59.216
Excuse me?

246
00:12:59.489 --> 00:13:01.526
That woman is not
going to have sex with you.

247
00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:04.018
I'm not trying to have sex with her.

248
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.145
Good. Then you won't be disappointed.

249
00:13:07.446 --> 00:13:09.730
What makes you think she
wouldn't have sex with me?

250
00:13:09.852 --> 00:13:11.778
I'm a male and she's a female.

251
00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:14.418
Yes, but not of the same species.

252
00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:17.752
I'm not going to engage
in hypotheticals here.

253
00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:19.624
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

254
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.100
Of course.

255
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.696
That's not to say that if a carnal
relationship were to develop,

256
00:13:24.818 --> 00:13:26.365
that I wouldn't participate.

257
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.848
However briefly.

258
00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.731
Do you think this possibility
will be helped or hindered

259
00:13:33.868 --> 00:13:37.284
when she discovers your Luke Skywalker
no-more-tears shampoo?

260
00:13:38.548 --> 00:13:39.970
It's Darth Vader shampoo.

261
00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:43.849
Luke Skywalker's the conditioner.

262
00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:49.166
- Wait till you see this.
- It's fantastic, unbelievable.

263
00:13:49.289 --> 00:13:50.289
See what?

264
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:55.655
It's a Stephen Hawking lecture
from MIT in 1974.

265
00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:56.867
This isn't a good time.

266
00:13:56.989 --> 00:14:00.037
It's before he became
a creepy computer voice.

267
00:14:03.412 --> 00:14:05.354
- That's great. You guys have to go.
- Why?

268
00:14:05.476 --> 00:14:06.673
It's just not a good time.

269
00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:08.387
Leonard has a lady over.

270
00:14:09.002 --> 00:14:11.489
Yeah, right... your
grandmother back in town?

271
00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:17.298
And she's not a lady.
She's just a new neighbor.

272
00:14:17.579 --> 00:14:19.984
Hang on, there really is a lady here?

273
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:24.201
And you want us out because
you're anticipating coitus?

274
00:14:24.705 --> 00:14:26.349
I'm not anticipating coitus.

275
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:27.768
So she's available for coitus?

276
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.262
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

277
00:14:30.384 --> 00:14:33.165
Technically, that would
be "coitus interruptus."

278
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.934
Hey, is there a trick to getting it
to switch from tub to shower...?

279
00:14:37.539 --> 00:14:39.550
Hi. Sorry.
Hello.

280
00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:43.241
Enchant? mademoiselle.

281
00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:48.629
Howard Wolowitz,
Caltech department of applied physics.

282
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:50.883
You may be familiar
with some of my work.

283
00:14:51.005 --> 00:14:53.512
It's currently orbiting
Jupiter's largest moon

284
00:14:53.634 --> 00:14:56.066
taking high-resolution
digital photographs.

285
00:14:57.158 --> 00:14:59.468
Penny. I work at The Cheesecake Factory.

286
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.882
I'll show you the trick with the shower.

287
00:15:02.418 --> 00:15:03.418
Bonne douche.

288
00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:05.560
I'm sorry?

289
00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:07.544
It's French for "good shower."

290
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:10.345
It's a sentiment I can express
in six languages.

291
00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:12.933
Save it for your blog, Howard.

292
00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:23.344
All right, there it goes.
It sticks. I'm sorry.

293
00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.014
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

294
00:15:25.136 --> 00:15:27.179
You're just gonna
step right... Okay, I'll...

295
00:15:28.167 --> 00:15:30.819
- Hey, Leonard?
- The hair products are Sheldon's.

296
00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.675
Can I ask you a favor?

297
00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:35.805
A favor?

298
00:15:36.431 --> 00:15:39.533
Sure, you can ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

299
00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:41.864
It's okay if you say no.

300
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:43.606
I'll probably say yes.

301
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.163
It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

302
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:02.963
I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

303
00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:04.469
- Must we?
- Event A.

304
00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.700
A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

305
00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:10.232
Event B, we drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set

306
00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:12.249
from the aforementioned
woman's ex-boyfriend.

307
00:16:12.436 --> 00:16:14.529
Query,
on what plane of existence

308
00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:17.862
is there even a semi-rational
link between these events?

309
00:16:19.022 --> 00:16:21.322
She asked me to do her
a favor, Sheldon.

310
00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:24.167
Yes, well, that maybe
the proximal cause of our journey,

311
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.681
but we both know it only exists
in contradistinction

312
00:16:26.803 --> 00:16:28.663
to the higher level distal cause.

313
00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:31.034
- Which is?
- You think with your penis.

314
00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:35.861
That's a biological impossibility.
And you didn't have to come.

315
00:16:35.983 --> 00:16:38.995
Right, I could have stayed behind
and watch Wolowitz try to hit on Penny

316
00:16:39.118 --> 00:16:40.676
in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

317
00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.355
Why can't she get her own TV?

318
00:16:43.546 --> 00:16:45.415
Come on, you know
how it is with breakups.

319
00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:47.648
No, I don't...
and neither do you.

320
00:16:48.857 --> 00:16:50.321
I broke up with Joyce Kim.

321
00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:53.696
You did not break up with Joyce Kim.
She defected to North Korea.

322
00:16:53.983 --> 00:16:55.658
To mend her broken heart.

323
00:16:59.135 --> 00:17:01.786
This situation is much less complicated.

324
00:17:01.952 --> 00:17:04.536
There's some kind of dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend

325
00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:06.271
as to who gets custody of the TV.

326
00:17:06.517 --> 00:17:08.534
She just wanted to avoid
having a scene with him.

327
00:17:08.656 --> 00:17:10.318
So we get to
have a scene with him?

328
00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:12.663
No, Sheldon, there's not
going to be a scene.

329
00:17:13.008 --> 00:17:14.703
There's two of us and one of him.

330
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.586
Leonard, the two of us
can't even carry a TV.

331
00:17:19.735 --> 00:17:22.619
So, you guys work with Leonard
and Sheldon at the university?

332
00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:30.412
I'm sorry, do you speak English?

333
00:17:31.249 --> 00:17:33.938
He speaks English.
He just can't speak to women.

334
00:17:34.823 --> 00:17:36.094
Really? Why?

335
00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:37.898
He's kind of a nerd.

336
00:17:40.874 --> 00:17:41.874
Juice box?

337
00:17:47.163 --> 00:17:48.283
I'll do the talking.

338
00:17:48.762 --> 00:17:51.571
- Yeah?
- Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

339
00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:53.317
- Hello.
- What did I just...

340
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.450
- We're here to pick up Penny's TV.
- Get lost.

341
00:17:58.572 --> 00:17:59.747
Okay, thanks for your time.

342
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.209
We're not going
to give up just like that.

343
00:18:02.336 --> 00:18:03.738
Leonard, the TV's in the building.

344
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.656
We've been denied access
to the building, ergo, we are done.

345
00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:09.783
Excuse me. If I were to give up
on the first little hitch,

346
00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:12.550
I never would have identified
the fingerprints of string theory

347
00:18:12.672 --> 00:18:14.462
in the aftermath of the Big Bang.

348
00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.878
My apologies. What's your plan?

349
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:34.610
It's just a privilege to watch
your mind at work.

350
00:18:35.805 --> 00:18:38.512
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360.

351
00:18:38.634 --> 00:18:41.522
We should be able to figure out
how to get into a stupid building.

352
00:18:45.652 --> 00:18:47.251
What do you think their combined IQ is?

353
00:18:47.374 --> 00:18:48.374
Just grab the door!

354
00:18:51.098 --> 00:18:52.098
This is it.

355
00:18:53.659 --> 00:18:54.794
I'll do the talking.

356
00:18:55.047 --> 00:18:57.221
Good thinking.
I'll just be the muscle.

357
00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:05.876
Yeah?

358
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.737
I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.

359
00:19:08.202 --> 00:19:09.214
From the intercom.

360
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.958
How the hell did you get
in the building?

361
00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:15.786
We're scientists.

362
00:19:18.164 --> 00:19:19.558
Tell him about our IQ.

363
00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.125
- Leonard...
- What?

364
00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:36.642
- My mom bought me those pants.
- I'm sorry.

365
00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:39.965
You're going to have to call her.

366
00:19:42.735 --> 00:19:45.510
Sheldon, I am so sorry
I dragged you through this.

367
00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:49.429
It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing
and it won't be my last.

368
00:19:50.358 --> 00:19:51.822
And you were right about my motives.

369
00:19:51.944 --> 00:19:55.307
I was hoping to establish
a relationship with Penny

370
00:19:55.429 --> 00:19:57.437
that might have someday led to sex.

371
00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:00.502
Well, you got me out of my pants.

372
00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:04.349
Anyway, I've learned my lesson.

373
00:20:04.527 --> 00:20:06.305
She's out of my league,
I'm done with her.

374
00:20:06.427 --> 00:20:09.352
Got my work, one day
I'll win the Nobel Prize

375
00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:10.628
and then I'll die alone.

376
00:20:10.881 --> 00:20:13.753
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

377
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.303
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

378
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.090
And you're certainly not
going to win a Nobel Prize.

379
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:25.205
This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

380
00:20:25.545 --> 00:20:26.969
They have a great house ale.

381
00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:28.692
Cool tiger.

382
00:20:28.814 --> 00:20:30.779
Yeah, I've had him since level ten.

383
00:20:31.928 --> 00:20:33.254
His name is Buttons.

384
00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:36.499
Anyway, if you had
your own game character

385
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:38.916
we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.

386
00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:41.706
That sounds interesting.

387
00:20:42.073 --> 00:20:43.085
You'll think about it?

388
00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:45.938
I don't think I'll be able
to stop thinking about it.

389
00:20:47.911 --> 00:20:48.963
Smooth.

390
00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:52.303
We're home.

391
00:20:52.893 --> 00:20:54.506
My God, what happened?

392
00:20:54.684 --> 00:20:56.741
Well, your ex-boyfriend
sends his regards

393
00:20:56.863 --> 00:20:59.637
and I think the rest
is fairly self-explanatory.

394
00:21:00.349 --> 00:21:03.615
I'm so sorry. I really thought
if you guys went instead of me

395
00:21:03.738 --> 00:21:04.997
he wouldn't be such an ass.

396
00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.106
No, it was a valid hypothesis.

397
00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:09.893
That was a valid...?
What is happening to you?

398
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.616
Really, thank you so much
for going and trying, you're just...

399
00:21:15.367 --> 00:21:18.142
You're so terrific. Really.

400
00:21:19.459 --> 00:21:20.909
Why don't you put some clothes on,

401
00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.163
I'll get my purse,
and dinner is on me, okay?

402
00:21:23.288 --> 00:21:24.497
- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

403
00:21:31.033 --> 00:21:32.973
You're not done with her, are you?

404
00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:36.648
Are babies will be smart and beautiful.

405
00:21:39.358 --> 00:21:40.861
Not to mention imaginary.

406
00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:53.326
- Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
- Sure.

407
00:21:53.448 --> 00:21:54.454
We can't have Thai food,

408
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.217
- we had Indian for lunch.
- So?

409
00:21:56.574 --> 00:21:58.923
- They're both curry-based cuisines.
- So?

410
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.905
It would be gastronomically redundant.

411
00:22:01.152 --> 00:22:04.948
I can see we're going to have
to spell out everything for this girl.

412
00:22:05.453 --> 00:22:06.670
Any ideas, Raj?

413
00:22:09.139 --> 00:22:11.302
Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

414
00:22:11.424 --> 00:22:14.177
I know a wonderful
little sushi bar that has karaoke.

415
00:22:14.303 --> 00:22:15.505
That sounds like fun.

416
00:22:28.939 --> 00:22:31.235
I don't know what your odds
are in the world as a whole,

417
00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:33.334
but as far as the population
of this car goes,

418
00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:35.124
you're a veritable mack daddy.
