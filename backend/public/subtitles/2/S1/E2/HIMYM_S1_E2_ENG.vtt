00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.416
TED:
Okay, where was I?

2
00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.151
You were telling us
how you met Mom.

3
00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.452
In excruciating detail.

4
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:19.587
Right.

5
00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.654
So, back in 2005,

6
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.291
when I was 27,

7
00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.858
my two best friends
got engaged,

8
00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.361
and it got me thinking,
maybe I should get married.

9
00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:29.663
And then I saw Robin.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.865
She was incredible.

11
00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.934
I just knew I had to meet her.

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.170
That's where
your Uncle Barney came in.

13
00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:37.605
I suggest we play
a little game I like to call

14
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.906
"Have you met Ted?"

15
00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.608
Wait, no, no, no.
We're not playing
"Have you met Ted?"

16
00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:42.210
Hi. Have you met Ted?

17
00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:44.878
So I asked her out.

18
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.247
And I know this sounds crazy,

19
00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.582
but after just one date,
I was in love with her

20
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.018
which made me say
something stupid.

21
00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:52.586
I think I'm in
love with you.

22
00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:53.654
What?!

23
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.089
Oh, Dad.

24
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:56.957
So then what happened?

25
00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.426
Nothing.

26
00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:00.761
I mean, I'd made
a complete fool of myself.

27
00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:04.465
So, a week went by,
and I decided not to call her.

28
00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.400
So you're not gonna call her?

29
00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:07.935
You went from,
"I think I'm
in love with you"

30
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.237
to "I'm not
gonna call her"?

31
00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:10.704
I wasn't
in love with her, okay?

32
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.006
I was briefly in love
with the abstract concept

33
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.108
of getting married.

34
00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:15.876
It had absolutely
nothing to do with Robin.

35
00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.411
Robin.

36
00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:18.179
Hi.

37
00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:19.513
Look who I ran into.

38
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.081
Since when do you guys
know each other?

39
00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.284
Oh, since about... here.

40
00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:24.652
Lily recognized me

41
00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:25.919
from the news and...

42
00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.821
Hello, sailor!

43
00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.089
They just got engaged.

44
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.594
Well, I should get
back to the station.

45
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.063
See you, guys.

46
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.398
Nice seeing you, Ted.

47
00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:38.566
Yeah, you, too.
Thanks.

48
00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:41.802
What? Damn it!

49
00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.537
I'm in love with her.

50
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:44.505
No!

51
00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:47.141
As your sponsor,
I will not let you relapse.

52
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:48.676
You blew it, it's over, move on.

53
00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:50.478
I don't know, I just
have this feeling

54
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.180
she's the future
Mrs. Ted Mosby.

55
00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.381
( Lily squeaks )

56
00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.450
Lily, you squeaked?

57
00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:57.985
She said something
about me, didn't she?

58
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.553
Come on,
spill it, Red!

59
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.921
Fine.

60
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.123
So, what do we
think of Ted?

61
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.225
( laughs )

62
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:06.394
Ted's something else.

63
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.328
Huh.

64
00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.230
I'm gonna spin that as good.

65
00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:12.166
Lots of guys are something,
I'm something else.

66
00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:13.501
Comes on a little strong.

67
00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.170
But, that's part of my charm.

68
00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:18.239
But, that's part
of his charm.

69
00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:20.274
Oh, totally. I mean,
he's sweet, he's charming,

70
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:21.575
he's just
looking for something

71
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.611
a little bit more serious
than I am.

72
00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.380
I mean, the most I can handle
right now is something casual.

73
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:28.782
This just stays
between us, right?

74
00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:29.950
Are you kidding?

75
00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:32.853
This flapper?
Fort Knox.

76
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.788
Oops.

77
00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.156
She wants casual.

78
00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:38.592
Okay, I'll be casual.

79
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.995
I'm going to be a mushroom cloud
of casual.

80
00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:43.063
You know why?

81
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.898
Cause it's a game--
I want her to skip

82
00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.335
to the end and do the whole
happily-ever-after thing.

83
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.670
But you don't get there
unless you play the game.

84
00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:51.138
So, are you going
to ask her out?

85
00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:52.240
Yeah... No!

86
00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:53.374
I can't ask her out,

87
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.043
because if I ask her
out, I'm asking her out.

88
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.278
So, how do I

89
00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:00.248
ask her out without
asking her out?

90
00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.619
Did you guys get high?

91
00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:07.020
I got it.

92
00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:08.556
I don't ask her out.

93
00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:10.057
I invite her

94
00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:12.159
to our party next Friday.

95
00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.761
We're having
a party next Friday?

96
00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:15.729
We are now. Casual.

97
00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:17.130
Yeah, cause nothing
says "casual"

98
00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.067
like inviting a hundred people
over just to mack on one girl.

99
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.536
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

100
00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.640
You waited five minutes
to tell me that?

101
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.243
All right,
so call her up.

102
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.611
No, calling's not casual.

103
00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:32.646
I just got to bump
into her somewhere.

104
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.282
Now, if only I
knew her schedule,

105
00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:36.517
I could arrange
a chance encounter.

106
00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:39.920
That's great, Ted-- you'll be
the most casual stalker ever.

107
00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.324
Now, ever since Marshall

108
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.526
put that ring on her finger,
Lily had been,

109
00:03:45.593 --> 00:03:49.297
well, extra affectionate.

110
00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:50.931
( chuckling ):
Baby, no.

111
00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:54.335
I have a 25-page paper on
constitutional law due Monday.

112
00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.903
I barely started.

113
00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.773
Hey, I'm just sitting
here, wearing my ring,

114
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.075
my beautiful ring.

115
00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.711
( typing )

116
00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:07.047
Kind of makes wearing
other stuff seem wrong.

117
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:08.816
Like my shirt.

118
00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:12.119
Kind of don't want to
wear my shirt anymore.

119
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.821
Or...

120
00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.356
my underwear.

121
00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:18.492
That's right, I'm
not wearing any.

122
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.828
( sighs )

123
00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.162
No underwear?

124
00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.397
Not even slightly.

125
00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:24.865
TED:
Guys.

126
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.337
Boundaries.

127
00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:30.538
There she is.

128
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.705
ROBIN ( on TV ):
Thanks, Bill.

129
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.541
I'm reporting from
the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket

130
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.009
on 75th and Columbus...

131
00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.279
75th and Columbus.

132
00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.482
Game on!

133
00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.417
...where four-year-old
Leroy Ellenberg has climbed

134
00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:46.820
inside a grab-a-prize machine
and gotten stuck.

135
00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:50.123
( panting )

136
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.193
And, all in the pursuit
of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

137
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.330
For Metro News 1,
I'm Robin Trubotsky.

138
00:04:56.397 --> 00:04:58.332
ENGINEER:
We're clear.

139
00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.200
ROBIN:
Thanks, Don.
Whew.

140
00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.335
Ted.

141
00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:03.236
Robin, wow!

142
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.038
What are the odds?

143
00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.006
What are you doing here?

144
00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:09.176
Oh, you know, just, uh,
shopping for, uh, dip.

145
00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:11.144
I love dip.

146
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.080
I mean, I don't love
dip, I like dip...

147
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.014
as a friend, you know.

148
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.716
( chuckles )
So, uh, hey,
you, uh,

149
00:05:15.783 --> 00:05:17.317
reporting a news
story or something?

150
00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:19.420
Yeah, kid stuck
in a crane machine.

151
00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:21.755
How sweet of you
to call it news.
Wow.

152
00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:23.791
Kid in a crane machine.
Mm-hmm.

153
00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:25.959
You just had to have
that toy, didn't you?

154
00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:27.828
Couldn't play the game
like everyone else.

155
00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:29.797
You're all sweaty!

156
00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:30.898
Cute kid.

157
00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:32.400
Um, you know,

158
00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:33.867
it's so funny
I should run into you.

159
00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:35.436
We're, uh, we're having a party
next Friday,

160
00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:36.504
if you feel like swinging by.

161
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.139
But, you know, whatever.

162
00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:40.541
Oh, I'm going back
home next weekend.

163
00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:42.342
It's too bad
it's not tonight.

164
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.144
It is... it's tonight.

165
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.046
This Friday.
Did I say next Friday?

166
00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:47.314
Sorry, I guess

167
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.849
I've been saying
next Friday all week.

168
00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.951
But, yeah, it's tonight,
the, uh, the party's tonight.

169
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:54.187
But, you know, whatever.

170
00:05:54.254 --> 00:05:58.325
( phone rings )

171
00:05:58.392 --> 00:05:59.527
Hello?

172
00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:01.429
Hey, am I interrupting
anything?

173
00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:03.296
No, no, I'm just
writing my paper.

174
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.698
Hitting the books.

175
00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:06.700
Yeah, well,
you and Lily

176
00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:08.469
might want to put
some clothes on.

177
00:06:08.536 --> 00:06:10.003
We're throwing
a party in two hours.

178
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.371
Okay, bye.

179
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.579
So, Gatsby,

180
00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:20.080
what are you gonna
do when Robin shows up?

181
00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.783
Okay, I got it all planned out.

182
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.953
She steps through the door--
and where's Ted?

183
00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.821
Not eagerly waiting
by the door.

184
00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.223
No, I'm across the room
at my drafting table,

185
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.928
showing some foxy young thing
all my cool architect stuff.

186
00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:38.198
So, Robin strolls over, and I
casually give her one of these:

187
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:41.201
"Hey, what's up?"

188
00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:45.573
She says, "Hey, nice place,
et cetera, et cetera."

189
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.941
And then, I say,
"Well, make yourself at home."

190
00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:50.010
And, I casually return
to my conversation.

191
00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:54.014
Then, an hour later...

192
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.316
"Oh, you're still here?"

193
00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.285
I say,
like I don't really care,

194
00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.953
but it's a nice surprise.

195
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.490
And then, very casually:

196
00:07:02.556 --> 00:07:04.858
"Want to see the roof?"

197
00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.261
BOTH:
The roof!
Get her up to the roof,

198
00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:10.263
and the roof
takes care of the rest.

199
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.065
What's so special
about the roof?

200
00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:14.802
Oh, the moon, the stars,
the shimmering skyline.

201
00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:18.606
You can't not fall in love
on that roof.

202
00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:21.341
We do it up
there, sometimes.

203
00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:23.143
Solid plan,
my little friend.

204
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.077
We're the same height.

205
00:07:24.144 --> 00:07:27.881
But, may I suggest one
little modification.

206
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.817
BARNEY:
That foxy young thing
you were chatting up,

207
00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:31.819
take her up to the roof
and have sex with her.

208
00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:33.621
Crazy monkey style...
That's not the plan.

209
00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:35.288
BARNEY:
Well, it should be the plan.

210
00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:36.490
I mean, look at her.

211
00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.091
Ted, look at her.
She's smoking!

212
00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:39.392
Thank you!
Yeah...

213
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.995
But, she's not Robin!

214
00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:43.063
Exactly!

215
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.732
Ted, let's rap.

216
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.534
Statistic: At every
New York party,

217
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.301
there's always a girl
who has no idea

218
00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.670
whose party she's at.

219
00:07:49.737 --> 00:07:50.904
She knows no
one you know,

220
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.606
and you will never
see her again.

221
00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:57.410
Do you see where I'm
going with this?

222
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.512
Barney, I don't think so.
( groans )

223
00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.213
Scoping.

224
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.281
( imitates sonar beeping )

225
00:08:01.348 --> 00:08:02.415
Scoping.

226
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.917
Man, you're a dork.

227
00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:05.252
( accelerates beeping sound )

228
00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.554
Target acquired!

229
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.188
Now it's time we
play a little game

230
00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:11.324
I like to call
"Have you met Ted?"
Oh, come on, not this.

231
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.360
Hi. Have you met Ted?
No.

232
00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.361
Hi. Hi.

233
00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:15.462
Do you know Marshall? Lily?

234
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:16.864
WOMAN:
No.

235
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.599
Hmm. Do you know
anyone at this party?

236
00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:20.300
I work with Carlos.

237
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:21.569
Excuse me.

238
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:22.836
Anyone know a Carlos?

239
00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.304
No.
No.

240
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.939
On a silver platter.

241
00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:28.075
Bon appÃ©tit.

242
00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.276
I don't think so.

243
00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.478
Your loss, her gain.

244
00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:32.546
Excuse me.

245
00:08:32.613 --> 00:08:33.781
Can I show you the roof?

246
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.448
It's magical up there.

247
00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:36.584
Sure.
TED:
Wait, wait.

248
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.751
Hey, hey, I got
that roof reserved.

249
00:08:37.818 --> 00:08:38.752
Dude, Robin's not coming.

250
00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:42.222
Hey, she's going
to show up!

251
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.593
She'll show up.

252
00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:48.261
TED:
She didn't show up.

253
00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:51.064
At least
it was a great party.

254
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.901
I ate, like, four
whole cans of dip.

255
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.403
You always know what to say,
old friend.

256
00:08:56.469 --> 00:09:00.240
( phone ringing )

257
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:01.575
It's Robin.

258
00:09:01.642 --> 00:09:02.743
Answer it.

259
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.612
No, no, not right away--
got to seem casual.

260
00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:06.513
( ringing continues )

261
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.048
Hello?

262
00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:10.217
I'm so sorry
I missed your party.

263
00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.285
Who is this? Meredith?

264
00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.353
Robin.

265
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.722
Oh, Robin!

266
00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:18.458
Hey! Yeah, I, uh, guess
you never showed up, did you?

267
00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:19.893
No, I got stuck at work.

268
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.429
But, they finally got that kid
out of the crane machine.

269
00:09:22.495 --> 00:09:23.997
Did he get to keep
the purple giraffe?

270
00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.233
Yeah, they let him keep
all the toys.

271
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.835
He was in there a long time,

272
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.870
and little kids
have small bladders.

273
00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:31.504
( chuckles )
ROBIN:
I wish your party

274
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.740
was tonight.

275
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.276
It is-- the party's tonight.

276
00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:38.445
Yeah, uh...

277
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.848
it's a two-day party,
'cause that's just how we roll.

278
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:45.452
Uh, so, if you want to swing by,
you know, it's casual.

279
00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.821
See ya.

280
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:52.425
So, that was Robin.
What are you

281
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:53.493
doing to me, man?!

282
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.328
I got a paper to write!
I know! Sorry!

283
00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:56.664
It's terrible!

284
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.532
I'll buy more dip!
Ted! Ted, wait!

285
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.703
Get French onion!

286
00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:06.807
Can you believe this guy?

287
00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:08.608
I got a paper to write.

288
00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:11.511
Okay, fine.

289
00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.413
But, it's got to be,
like, super-quick,

290
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.748
and no cuddling after.

291
00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:18.085
I'm the luckiest
girl alive.

292
00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.493
You were so right
about the roof!

293
00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.695
The roof!

294
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.998
The roof is
on fire, Ted!

295
00:10:31.064 --> 00:10:32.499
That girl from
last night--

296
00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.867
I took her back
to my place,

297
00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.235
then this morning,
took her outside,

298
00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.137
spun her around a
couple times and
sent her walking.

299
00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:39.873
She will never find her way
back, and there she is.

300
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.710
How did she get here?
Did you invite her?

301
00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:43.844
I have no idea who that is.

302
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:45.578
She said she works
with Carlos.
Who's Carlos?

303
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:46.613
I don't know any Carlos.

304
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.681
( frustrated groan )

305
00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.149
Hi, you!

306
00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:50.417
You're back!

307
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.551
I sure am.

308
00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.620
Mmm.

309
00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:55.756
Come on, sweetie,
I need a drink.

310
00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.624
"Sweetie"? Really?

311
00:10:57.691 --> 00:10:59.727
( barely audible ):
Help.

312
00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:02.095
Whoa! Whoa, rabbits!

313
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.530
Come on,

314
00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.698
I got that
roof reserved.

315
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.499
All right.

316
00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:10.603
So, it's over between me
and works-with-Carlos girl.

317
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.905
Whoa! That was fast.

318
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:13.440
Yeah. I was
trying to think,

319
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:17.010
what's the quickest
way to get rid of a
girl you just met?

320
00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.012
I think I'm in love with you.

321
00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.447
What?!

322
00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.283
Thanks, bro.
Glad I could help.

323
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:26.686
What the...
No, no, no. Come on.

324
00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:28.889
Sorry, Ted.

325
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.460
Great. What am I going to
do when Robin shows up?

326
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.862
She'll show up.

327
00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:36.563
She didn't show up.

328
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.331
All right.

329
00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:39.599
We threw two parties.

330
00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.134
Everybody had fun.

331
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:45.105
Everybody wanged,
everybody chunged.

332
00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:47.074
Now, the kid has
got to get to work,

333
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.575
and the kid is not
to be disturbed.

334
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:49.810
Repeat after me.

335
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:52.245
I will not have sex
with Marshall.

336
00:11:52.312 --> 00:11:55.615
BOTH:
I will not have sex
with Marshall.

337
00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:58.185
( phone ringing )

338
00:11:58.251 --> 00:12:01.154
It's Robin.

339
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.289
Hello?

340
00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.057
Hi, Ted.
Amanda?

341
00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:05.158
Oh, Denise!

342
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.394
Sorry, you totally sounded
like Amanda.

343
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.161
It's Robin.

344
00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.662
Oh, Robin.

345
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.764
Hi.

346
00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:12.632
I totally wanted to come.

347
00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:13.767
I got stuck at work again.

348
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.135
I feel like I live there.

349
00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:17.237
I'm sorry I missed your party,
again.

350
00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:20.507
Hey, ain't no thing
but a chicken wing, mamacita.

351
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:21.909
Who am I?

352
00:12:23.043 --> 00:12:24.444
I guess there's no chance
your two-dayer

353
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.779
turned into a three-dayer?

354
00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:27.680
It did, indeed.

355
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.216
The party continues tonight.

356
00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:30.683
Yeah.

357
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.886
Uh, last night,
people were like,
"Keep it going, bro.

358
00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:34.587
Party trifecta."

359
00:12:34.654 --> 00:12:35.655
Wow!

360
00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:37.224
Okay, well, I'll be there.

361
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.325
Great!

362
00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:39.359
See you tonight.

363
00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:43.363
So, that was Robin.

364
00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:48.401
So, I threw a third party
for Robin...

365
00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:50.570
on a Sunday night.

366
00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:52.940
Well, this is lame.

367
00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:55.475
Lame... or casual?

368
00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:56.776
Lame.

369
00:12:56.844 --> 00:12:58.979
Or casual?

370
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.681
Hey, law books.

371
00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:04.117
Ready for a little
15 minute recess?

372
00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:05.552
Sorry, baby,
I got to work.

373
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.988
I need all my blood up here.

374
00:13:08.055 --> 00:13:10.891
Has anybody seen An
Introduction to Contract Tort

375
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.127
and Restitution Statutes
from 1865-1923?

376
00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:17.164
Anybody seen a big-ass book?

377
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.999
ALL ( muttering ):
No.

378
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:21.568
WOMAN:
Hello, Barney.

379
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.303
Of course.

380
00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:27.140
You look well.

381
00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:29.042
Is it weird they invited
both of us?

382
00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:31.811
Who?

383
00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:33.513
Who invited you?

384
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.016
No one even knows
who you are!

385
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:41.188
I understand you're hurt,
but you don't have to be cruel.

386
00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:43.290
Carlos was right about you.

387
00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:46.226
Who is Carlos?!

388
00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:49.129
Hey, where the
hell is my...?

389
00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:50.463
Oh...!

390
00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:55.168
Okay...

391
00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:57.204
An Introduction
to Contract Tort

392
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.641
and Restitution Statutes
from 1865-1923

393
00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:03.410
is not a coaster!

394
00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:06.679
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law
career so you can throw not one,

395
00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:10.350
not two, but three parties
for some girl that you just met

396
00:14:10.417 --> 00:14:12.019
who's probably not even going
to show up!

397
00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:13.653
I mean, where
is she, Ted, huh?

398
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.455
Where's Robin?

399
00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:18.758
Hi.

400
00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:20.060
Hi, Robin.

401
00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:22.595
Wow.

402
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.671
So, you threw all these parties
for me?

403
00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.906
No.

404
00:14:32.973 --> 00:14:34.707
Oh, you thought that...
no!

405
00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:36.209
I... okay, yes.

406
00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:37.310
You got me.

407
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.379
One of the reasons
I threw these parties

408
00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:41.514
was so that
I could introduce you

409
00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.717
to, um, this guy.

410
00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.119
Uh, I figured, you know,

411
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.420
since it didn't work out
between us

412
00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:49.122
and now we can
just laugh about it...

413
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.958
( laughs weakly )

414
00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.492
Anyway, Robin,
this is...

415
00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:54.327
Carlos.

416
00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.496
Oh!
Oh!

417
00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:03.971
She's still talking
to Carlos.

418
00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:05.939
I can still win this.

419
00:15:06.006 --> 00:15:07.307
I-it's not over.

420
00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:08.241
Okay, buddy.

421
00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:09.642
Time for
the tough talk.

422
00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:12.946
Robin seems great,
but let's look at the facts.

423
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:14.381
You want
to get married.

424
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:15.282
And right now,

425
00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:16.816
there's a million women
in New York

426
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.718
looking for exactly you.

427
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:20.253
But Robin ain't
one of them.

428
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.621
She's not just
one of them.

429
00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:22.755
She's the one.

430
00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:26.093
Yeah, well, the one
is heading up to the roof.

431
00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.263
What are you going to do?

432
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.698
Nothing.

433
00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:32.899
It's a game.

434
00:15:32.966 --> 00:15:36.536
I got to just keep playing it.

435
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.579
( rock music playing )

436
00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:16.209
Ted...

437
00:16:16.276 --> 00:16:18.878
Hey, Carlos, can you
give us a minute?

438
00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.247
Hey, no sweat, hombre.

439
00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.215
See ya.

440
00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:26.919
Robin...

441
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.788
look, I didn't
throw this party

442
00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:29.989
to set you up
with Carlos,

443
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.592
or the one before that,
or the one before that.

444
00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:36.796
I threw these parties
because I wanted to see you.

445
00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:39.632
Well, here I am.

446
00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:43.936
There's something here,
look, unless I'm crazy.

447
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.073
You're not crazy.

448
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.142
I don't know, Ted.

449
00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.611
I mean, we barely
know each other

450
00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.646
and you're looking at me
with that look.

451
00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:54.781
And, it's like...

452
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.982
Like, like what?

453
00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.618
Like, "Let's fall in love
and get married

454
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.388
and have kids and drive them
to soccer practice."

455
00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:02.655
I'm not going
to force sports on them

456
00:17:02.722 --> 00:17:04.191
unless they're interested.

457
00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.192
( laughing )

458
00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.194
It's a great look.

459
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.795
But you're looking
at the wrong girl.

460
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.662
No, I'm not.

461
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:10.697
Yes, you are.

462
00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.800
I don't want to get married
right now, maybe ever.

463
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.135
And, if we got together,

464
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.404
I'd feel like I'd either have
to marry you

465
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.306
or break your heart, and...

466
00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:23.743
I just couldn't do
either of those things.

467
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.513
Just like you can't turn off
the way you feel.

468
00:17:29.816 --> 00:17:30.817
Click.

469
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.419
Off. Let's make out.

470
00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.787
What?

471
00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:36.789
What? That was
the off switch.

472
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.125
And I turned it off.

473
00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:40.527
I mean, look,
sure, yes,

474
00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:42.995
I want to fall in love, get
married, blah, blah, blah.

475
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:45.098
But, on the other hand...

476
00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:49.769
you, me, the roof.

477
00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:52.305
There's no off switch.

478
00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:55.208
There is an off switch.

479
00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:56.776
And it's off.

480
00:17:56.843 --> 00:17:59.512
No, it's not.

481
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.481
Yes, it is.

482
00:18:01.548 --> 00:18:02.549
No, it's not.

483
00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:05.552
Yes... it is.

484
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.034
No, it's not.

485
00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.102
You're right.

486
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.339
There's no off switch.

487
00:18:26.406 --> 00:18:29.142
God, I wish there
was an off switch!

488
00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:31.544
Me, too.

489
00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:36.616
( both laughing )

490
00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:37.517
So, um...

491
00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:38.885
( both muttering nervously )

492
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.721
What do we do now?

493
00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:44.357
We could be friends.

494
00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:46.826
Oh...

495
00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:48.195
Look,

496
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:51.231
I know it sounds insincere
when people say that,

497
00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:54.033
but... we could.

498
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.269
I don't know, Robin.

499
00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:57.804
I've made such a jackass
of myself here.

500
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.872
We start hanging out,
every time I see you

501
00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:01.208
it'll be like,
"Oh, that's right.

502
00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:02.842
I'm a jackass."

503
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:04.143
You're not a jackass.

504
00:19:04.211 --> 00:19:05.712
Look, I'm sorry.

505
00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:08.815
I only moved here in April
and I'm always working

506
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:12.619
and I just haven't met
a lot of good people so far.

507
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.123
But I understand.

508
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.194
Well, uh, maybe
in a few months,

509
00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:22.495
after it's not so fresh,

510
00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:26.399
we could all, uh,
you know, get a beer.

511
00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:28.668
Yeah.

512
00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:30.370
That sounds good.

513
00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:33.706
I'll see you, Ted.

514
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.513
Or, you know, now.

515
00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:47.186
We could all get a beer now.

516
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:50.790
I'd like that.

517
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.295
My friends are going
to love you...

518
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.664
like you, you know,
as a friend.

519
00:19:58.998 --> 00:19:59.932
Jackass.

520
00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:04.003
Unbelievable.

521
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.205
That's just a recipe

522
00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:07.974
for disaster.
They work together!

523
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.941
Are you jealous?

524
00:20:09.008 --> 00:20:10.076
Oh, please.

525
00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.679
What does Carlos have
that I don't?

526
00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:13.746
A date tonight.

527
00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:14.514
ALL:
Oh!

528
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:15.815
Stop the tape.
Rewind.

529
00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:16.983
Play it again.

530
00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.285
( imitates tape rewinding )
A date tonight.

531
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:19.886
ALL:
Oh!

532
00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.288
I'm not sure
I like her.

533
00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:23.523
Hey, don't you have a paper
to write?

534
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.825
Dude, you're talking to the kid.

535
00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:26.626
I know it.

536
00:20:26.693 --> 00:20:28.194
I'm going to knock back
this beer.

537
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:29.996
I'm going to knock back
one more beer.

538
00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.063
I'm going to go home.

539
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.799
I'm going to write
a 25-page paper.

540
00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:35.535
I'm going to hand it in
and I'm going to get an "A."

541
00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:38.405
My name is Rufus
and that's the trufus.

542
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:39.506
( laughter )

543
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.740
TED:
He got a B-minus.

544
00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:43.276
But still,
25 pages in one night, B-minus?

545
00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.378
The kid was good.

546
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:46.746
At least let me buy you a beer.

547
00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:47.547
Come on,

548
00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:48.848
I'll buy everyone a beer.

549
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:51.318
I'll help carry.

550
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.656
You know something,
Ted?
What?

551
00:20:56.723 --> 00:20:57.557
You are a catch.

552
00:20:57.624 --> 00:21:00.593
You're going to make
some girl very happy.

553
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.129
And I am going
to help you find her.

554
00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:05.665
Well, good luck.

555
00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:07.800
I mean, maybe New York's
just too big a town.

556
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:09.936
I mean, there's millions
of people in this city.

557
00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.304
How, in all this mess,

558
00:21:11.371 --> 00:21:13.473
is a guy supposed to find
the love of his life?

559
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.475
I mean, where
do you even begin?

560
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.945
Hi.

561
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.547
Have you met Ted?

562
00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:26.353
( music rises over dialogue )
