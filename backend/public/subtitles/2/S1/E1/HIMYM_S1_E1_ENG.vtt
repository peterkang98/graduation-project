00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:05.839
MAN:
Kids, I'm gonna tell you

2
00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:06.940
an incredible story;

3
00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:08.576
the story of how

4
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.278
I met your mother.

5
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:11.612
Are we being punished
for something?

6
00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:12.546
No.

7
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.415
Yeah, is this gonna
take a while?

8
00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:18.352
Yes. 25 years ago,
before I was Dad,

9
00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:20.488
I had this whole other life.

10
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.494
It was way back in 2005.

11
00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.463
I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect

12
00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:30.731
and living in New York
with Marshall,

13
00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.300
my best friend from college.

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.767
My life was good.

15
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.004
And then Uncle Marshall went
and screwed the whole thing up.

16
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.473
Will you marry me?

17
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:41.175
Yes.

18
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:42.976
Perfect!
And then you're engaged.

19
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.912
You pop the champagne.
You drink a toast.

20
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.614
You have sex
on the kitchen floor.

21
00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:47.948
Don't have sex
on our kitchen floor.

22
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:49.083
Got it.

23
00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:50.851
Thanks for helping me
plan this out, Ted.

24
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:51.852
Dude, are you kidding?

25
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.053
It's you and Lilly.

26
00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:54.988
I've been there
for all the big moments
of you and Lilly:

27
00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.590
night you met,

28
00:00:56.624 --> 00:01:00.594
your first date,
other first things.

29
00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:01.295
Yeah, sorry.

30
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.264
We thought you were asleep.

31
00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.698
It's physics, Marshall.

32
00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:07.835
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

33
00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:10.438
My God.

34
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.740
You're getting engaged tonight.

35
00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.908
Yeah.

36
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:16.043
What are you doin' tonight?

37
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.646
What was I doing?

38
00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.081
Here Uncle Marshall was taking
the biggest step of his life.

39
00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:22.183
And me?

40
00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.252
I'm calling up
your Uncle Barney.

41
00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:26.187
Hey, so you know
how I've always had a thing

42
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.321
for half-Asian girls?

43
00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.427
Well, now I've got
a new favorite-- Lebanese girls.

44
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:35.629
Lebanese girls
are the new half-Asians.

45
00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:37.431
Hey, you want
to do somethin' tonight?

46
00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.601
Okay, meet me at the bar
in 15 minutes. And suit up!

47
00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:44.238
Hey.

48
00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:46.740
Where's your suit?
Just once,

49
00:01:46.774 --> 00:01:48.776
when I say suit up,
I wish you'd put on a suit.

50
00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:50.144
I did that one time.

51
00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:52.746
It was a blazer!

52
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.114
You know,

53
00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:57.017
ever since college
it's been, Marshall
and Lilly and me.

54
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.153
Now, it's gonna be
Marshall and Lilly...

55
00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:00.588
and me.

56
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.290
They'll get married,
start a family.

57
00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:05.092
Before long,
I'm that weird,
middle-aged bachelor

58
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.594
their kids call
Uncle Ted.

59
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.897
I see what this is about.

60
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.633
Have you forgotten
what I said to you
the night we met?

61
00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:17.571
Ted, I'm gonna teach
you how to live.

62
00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.208
Barney.
We met at the urinal.

63
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:21.842
Oh, right. Right.

64
00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.477
Lesson one:
lose the goatee.

65
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.845
It doesn't go
with your suit.

66
00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.214
I'm not wearing a suit.

67
00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:27.915
Lesson two: get a suit.

68
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.318
Suits are cool.
Exhibit "A."

69
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:32.019
Lesson three:
don't even think

70
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:35.256
about getting married
till you're 30.

71
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.657
30. Right.
You're right.

72
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.560
I guess it's just,
your best friend
gets engaged,

73
00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:40.694
you start thinking
about that stuff.

74
00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.364
I thought I was
your best friend.

75
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.666
Ted, say
I'm your best friend.

76
00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.001
You're my best
friend, Barney.

77
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.337
Good. Then,
as your best friend,

78
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.704
I suggest we play
a little game

79
00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.406
I like to call
"Have you met Ted?"

80
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.141
Wait. No, no, no.
We're not playing
"Have you met Ted?"

81
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.476
Hi, have you met Ted?

82
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.944
Hi,

83
00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.679
I'm Ted.

84
00:02:58.712 --> 00:02:59.513
Yasmine.

85
00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:00.881
That's a very pretty name.

86
00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.716
Thanks. It's Lebanese.

87
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.120
Hey.

88
00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:08.088
( sighs )

89
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.189
I'm exhausted.

90
00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:11.525
It was finger-painting day
at school,

91
00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.895
and a five year-old boy got
to second base with me.

92
00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:18.131
Wow! You're cooking?

93
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.967
Yes, I am.

94
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.170
Aw...

95
00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.472
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

96
00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:28.008
After last time, you looked
really creepy without eyebrows.

97
00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:29.042
I can handle this.

98
00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.678
I think you'll
find I'm full of
surprises tonight.

99
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.546
So, there's more surprises?
Likewhat?

100
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.283
Marshall was in his second year
of law school,

101
00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:37.885
so he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.

102
00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.953
Boogedyboo!

103
00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.456
And that's all of 'em.

104
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.692
I'm gonna go... cook.

105
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.861
I'm so happy for Marshall,
I really am.

106
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:49.663
I just couldn't imagine
settling down right now.

107
00:03:49.697 --> 00:03:51.399
So, do you think
you'll ever get married?

108
00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:55.303
Well, maybe eventually...
some fall day,

109
00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:56.437
possibly in Central Park.

110
00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.240
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

111
00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.109
Band, no DJ.
People will dance!

112
00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.444
I'm not gonna worry
about it!

113
00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:07.047
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

114
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.181
Yeah, nothing hotter

115
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.084
than a guy planning out
his own imaginary wedding, huh?

116
00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.086
Actually,
I think it's cute.

117
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.788
Well, you're clearly drunk.

118
00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:15.989
One more for the lady!

119
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:19.460
Oh, hey,
look what I got.

120
00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:26.334
Oh, honey! Champagne.

121
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.136
Yeah.

122
00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.041
No. You are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

123
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:35.042
I'm not scared.

124
00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:35.876
Then open it.

125
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.010
Fine.

126
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.547
Please open it?

127
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.516
You are unbelievable,
Marshall.

128
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.652
There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.

129
00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.820
One, you plan out for months.

130
00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:49.256
The other just slips out when
you're half drunk at some bar.

131
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.524
Will you marry me?

132
00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:52.360
You wanna go out
sometime?

133
00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:54.395
Of course, you idiot!

134
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.766
I'm sorry,
Carl's my boyfriend.

135
00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:03.504
'Sup, Carl?

136
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.574
( both sigh )

137
00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:09.877
I promised Ted
we wouldn't do that.

138
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.080
Did you know
there's a Pop Tart
under your fridge?

139
00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.115
No, but dibs.

140
00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:18.185
Where's that champagne?

141
00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.187
I wanna drink a toast
with my fiancÃ©e.

142
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.922
Oh!

143
00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.594
I don't know why
I was so scared of this.

144
00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:28.362
It's pretty easy, right?

145
00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:29.930
Oh!
( Lilly shrieks )

146
00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:32.366
Why am I freaking out
all of a sudden?

147
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.735
This is crazy.
I'm not ready
to settle down.

148
00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.671
How does Carl land
a Lebanese girl?

149
00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:38.839
The plan has always been

150
00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.808
don't even think about it
until you're 30.

151
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.643
Exactly. The guy doesn't
even own a suit.

152
00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:45.245
Plus, Marshall's found
the love of his life.

153
00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:47.347
Even if I was ready,
which I'm not...

154
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.716
but if I was,
it's, like,

155
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:53.253
"Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?"

156
00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:56.590
( romantic music plays )

157
00:05:56.624 --> 00:05:58.692
And there she was.

158
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.100
It was like something
from an old movie,

159
00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:08.268
where the sailor sees the girl

160
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.570
across the crowded dance floor,

161
00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:13.507
turns to his buddy and says,
"See that girl?

162
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.208
I'm gonna marry her someday."

163
00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:17.811
Hey, Barney,
see that girl?

164
00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:21.214
Oh, yeah. You just know
she likes it dirty.

165
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.583
Go say hi.

166
00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.785
I can't just go say hi.

167
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:25.819
I need a plan.

168
00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:27.254
I'm gonna wait
until she goes
to the bathroom,

169
00:06:27.287 --> 00:06:29.256
then I'll strategically place
myself by the jukebox...

170
00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.391
Hi, have you met Ted?

171
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:34.828
Hi.

172
00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.964
Let me guess...

173
00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:38.165
Ted.

174
00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:43.437
Sorry, Lilly.
I'm so sorry.

175
00:06:43.471 --> 00:06:44.472
Take us to the hospital.

176
00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

177
00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:46.607
Did you hit her?

178
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.909
( both laugh )

179
00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:49.943
Hit me? Please!

180
00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.746
This guy can barely
even spank me in
bed for fun.

181
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.649
He's all like, "Oh, honey.
Did that hurt?"

182
00:06:55.683 --> 00:06:57.384
And, I'm like,
"Come on!

183
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.219
Let me have it,
you pansy!"

184
00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.254
Wow, a complete stranger.

185
00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:03.256
No, no, no, no! It's okay.
Go on.

186
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.494
So, these,
uh, spankings...

187
00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:10.097
you in pajamas
or au naturel?

188
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:10.898
So, what do you do?

189
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.833
I'm a reporter
for Metro News One.

190
00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:13.701
Oh.

191
00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.302
Well, kind of a reporter.

192
00:07:15.335 --> 00:07:17.170
I do those dumb
little fluff pieces

193
00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:18.338
at the end of the news.

194
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:21.509
You know, like, um...
monkey who can play
the ukulele.

195
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.244
I'm hoping to get
some bigger stories soon.

196
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.414
Bigger, like, uh...
gorilla with an upright bass?

197
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.116
Sorry.
You're really pretty.

198
00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.150
( laughs )

199
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.288
Oh, your friends
don't seem to happy.

200
00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.124
Yeah, see, the one
in the middle just
got dumped

201
00:07:37.157 --> 00:07:38.492
by her boyfriend.

202
00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:40.127
So, tonight, every guy
is "the enemy."

203
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.829
You know if it'll make
your friend feel better,

204
00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:43.564
you could throw a drink
in my face. I don't mind.

205
00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.465
She would love that!

206
00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:48.702
And it does look
fun in the movies.

207
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:50.403
Hey, you wanna have dinner
with me Saturday night?

208
00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:54.708
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando
for a week on Friday.

209
00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.409
Some guy's attempting to make
the world's biggest pancake.

210
00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:57.811
Guess who's covering it?

211
00:07:57.845 --> 00:07:59.379
That's gonna take a week?

212
00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:00.781
Yeah, he's gonna
eat it, too.

213
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.282
It's another record.

214
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.450
Hey! What's takin' so long?

215
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.485
Uh, I know this
is a long shot,

216
00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.521
but how 'bout tomorrow night?

217
00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.824
Yeah. What the hell?

218
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.532
Jerk!

219
00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:19.733
That was fun.

220
00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:23.103
De... wait for it...

221
00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.404
nied!

222
00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.039
Denied!

223
00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:27.675
We're goin' out
tomorrow night.

224
00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.910
I thought we were playin'
laser tag tomorrow night.

225
00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:33.246
Yeah, I was never gonna
go play laser tag.

226
00:08:37.484 --> 00:08:38.652
The next night,
I took her out

227
00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:39.953
to this little bistro
in Brooklyn.

228
00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:40.921
Wow!

229
00:08:40.954 --> 00:08:43.490
That is one badass
blue French horn.

230
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.058
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

231
00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:47.294
Sort of looks
like a Smurf penis.

232
00:08:47.327 --> 00:08:51.064
Son, a piece of advice:
when you go on a first date,

233
00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:53.801
you really don't wanna say
"Smurf penis."

234
00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:57.337
Girls don't
ordinarily like that.

235
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.073
But this was no ordinary girl.

236
00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:01.008
( laughing )

237
00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:05.345
Lilly?

238
00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.714
( table clatters )

239
00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.116
How long have
you been sitting there?

240
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:11.652
Stupid eye patch.

241
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.888
Mom, Dad,

242
00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:17.625
I have found
the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

243
00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.392
Marshall, how have I always

244
00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:20.260
described my perfect woman?

245
00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:21.695
Now, let's see...

246
00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:23.230
she likes dogs?

247
00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:24.665
I've got five dogs.

248
00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:25.633
She drinks scotch?

249
00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:26.967
I love a scotch that's old

250
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.769
enough to order its own scotch.

251
00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:30.771
Can quote obscure lines
from Ghostbusters?

252
00:09:30.804 --> 00:09:35.809
Ray! When someone asks you
if you're a god, you say "Yes!"

253
00:09:35.843 --> 00:09:37.945
And I'm saving
the best for last.

254
00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.513
Do you want these?
I hate olives.

255
00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.716
She hates olives! Awesome!

256
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.484
The olive theory.

257
00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:47.554
The olive theory
is based on my friends
Marshall and Lilly.

258
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.056
He hates olives,
she loves them.

259
00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.491
In a weird way,
that's what makes
them such a great couple.

260
00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.993
Perfect balance.

261
00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.462
You know, I've had
a jar of olives

262
00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:57.931
just sitting
in my fridge forever.

263
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:01.669
I could take 'em
off your hands.

264
00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:04.371
They're all yours.

265
00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:06.106
Oh, it is on!

266
00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.775
It is on

267
00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:09.342
( singing ):
till the break of dawn.

268
00:10:10.577 --> 00:10:12.179
But wait.

269
00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.047
It's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

270
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:16.750
I gotta get one
of those blue
French horns

271
00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:17.951
for over my fireplace.

272
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.220
It's gotta be blue.
It's gotta be French.

273
00:10:20.253 --> 00:10:21.088
No green clarinet?

274
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.656
Nope.
Come on.
No purple tuba?

275
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.825
It's a Smurf penis
or no dice.

276
00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:25.826
( laughs )

277
00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.728
WOMAN:
There you are!

278
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:28.829
We got a jumper.

279
00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:30.630
Some crazy guy
on the Manhattan Bridge.

280
00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:31.899
Come on. You're coverin' it!

281
00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:35.435
Um... all right.
I'll be right there.

282
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.772
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:40.440
I had a really
great time tonight.

284
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.275
Yeah.

285
00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:43.443
So?!

286
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:44.745
Did you kiss her?

287
00:10:44.778 --> 00:10:46.847
No. The moment wasn't right.

288
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.216
Look, this woman
could actually be
my future wife.

289
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:50.984
I want our first kiss
to be amazing.

290
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:54.021
Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.

291
00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:57.357
So you chickened out
like a little bitch.

292
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.693
What? I did not chicken out.

293
00:10:59.727 --> 00:11:00.861
You know what?

294
00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:03.063
I don't need to take
first kiss advice

295
00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.631
from some pirate
who hasn't been single

296
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.899
since the first week of college.

297
00:11:05.933 --> 00:11:08.702
Anyone who's single
would tell you
the same thing,

298
00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:11.004
even the dumbest
single person alive.

299
00:11:11.038 --> 00:11:13.640
And if you don't believe me,
call him.

300
00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.308
( rock music playing )

301
00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.376
Hey, loser.

302
00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:18.145
How's not playing laser tag?

303
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:19.646
Because playing
laser tag is awesome!

304
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.514
Oh, I killed you,
Conner!

305
00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:23.216
Don't make me
get your mom!

306
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.852
Hey, listen.
I need your opinion
on something.

307
00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.219
Okay, meet me
at the bar in
15 minutes.

308
00:11:26.253 --> 00:11:27.788
And suit up!

309
00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.891
So, these guys
think I chickened out.

310
00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:32.259
What do you think?

311
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:37.097
I can't believe you're
still not wearing a suit.

312
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.799
She didn't even
give me the signal.

313
00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:40.100
What, is she gonna, she gonna

314
00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.102
bat her eyes at you
in Morse code?

315
00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.471
"Ted...

316
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:45.505
kiss me."

317
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.940
No! You just kiss her!

318
00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:49.442
Not if you don't
get the signal.

319
00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:53.713
Did Marshall
give me the signal?

320
00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:54.848
No!

321
00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:57.050
I didn't. I swear.

322
00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.586
But, see,
at least tonight,

323
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.221
I get to sleep knowing
Marshall and me,

324
00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:02.055
never gonna happen.

325
00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:03.090
You should have
kissed her.

326
00:12:03.123 --> 00:12:04.925
Oh, I should have kissed her.

327
00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.394
Well, maybe in a week when
she gets back from Orlando.

328
00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:09.963
A week? That's like
a year in hot girl time.

329
00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:11.331
She'll forget all about you.

330
00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:14.401
Mark my words-- you will
never see that one again.

331
00:12:14.434 --> 00:12:15.936
There she is.

332
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.971
Ooh! She's cute.

333
00:12:18.005 --> 00:12:19.439
Hey, Carl,
turn it up.

334
00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.507
...persuaded him to reconsider.

335
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.310
At which point, the man
came down off the ledge,

336
00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:26.847
giving this bizarre story
a happy ending.

337
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.248
Reporting from Metro One News...
Huh.

338
00:12:28.281 --> 00:12:29.516
Guy didn't jump.

339
00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:31.751
I'm gonna go kiss her.

340
00:12:31.785 --> 00:12:33.586
Right now.

341
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.822
Look, dude.
It's midnight.

342
00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:36.223
As your future lawyer,

343
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.725
I'm gonna advise you
that's freakin' crazy.

344
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.193
I never do anything crazy.

345
00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:41.895
I'm always
waiting for the moment,

346
00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.030
planning the moment.

347
00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:44.431
Well, she's leaving tomorrow.

348
00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:46.699
This may be
the only moment I'm gonna get.

349
00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.435
I gotta do what
that guy couldn't.

350
00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:49.903
I gotta take the leap!

351
00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:52.205
Okay, not a perfect metaphor,

352
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.574
'cause for me it's fall
in love and get married,

353
00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:55.909
and for him it's... death.

354
00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:59.079
Actually, that
is a perfect metaphor.

355
00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:01.448
By the way, did I
congratulate you two?

356
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.716
I'm doing this.

357
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.152
Let's go.

358
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:06.119
Word up.

359
00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:07.554
We're coming
with you.

360
00:13:07.587 --> 00:13:09.622
Barney?

361
00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:11.691
All right,

362
00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.793
but under one condition.

363
00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:16.196
Look at you, you
beautiful bastard.

364
00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.197
You suited up!

365
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.266
This is totally
going in my blog!

366
00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.934
Stop the car.

367
00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.435
Uh, pull over
right here.

368
00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:25.472
I gotta do something.

369
00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.908
Excuse me. Pardon me.

370
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.642
Just a sec'.
Enjoy your coffee.

371
00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:30.643
Hey!

372
00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:31.644
Hey!

373
00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.813
Go! Go! Go!

374
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.286
Everybody
brings flowers.

375
00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.427
( exhales )

376
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.529
Okay.
Moment of truth.

377
00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:52.032
Wish me luck.

378
00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:54.701
Ted's gonna get it on
with a TV reporter.

379
00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:57.437
"This just in." Okay.

380
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.741
Kiss her, Ted!

381
00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:02.910
Kiss her good!

382
00:14:02.943 --> 00:14:05.078
Kiss the crap
outta that girl!

383
00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:06.213
Marshall, remember this night.

384
00:14:06.246 --> 00:14:08.281
When you're the best man
at our wedding

385
00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.951
and you give a speech,
you're gonna tell this story.

386
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:15.122
Why does he get
to be the best man?

387
00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:17.090
I'm your
best friend!

388
00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:18.992
As I walked up to that door,

389
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.593
a million thoughts
raced through my mind.

390
00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:23.730
Unfortunately, one particular
thought did not.

391
00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:25.265
I've got five dogs.

392
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:27.100
( doorbell buzzes, barking )

393
00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:29.469
Not good. Not good.
Not good. Not good. Not good.

394
00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:30.537
No!

395
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.538
Get back in there!

396
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:32.672
You're wearing
a suit!

397
00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:36.176
( barking continues )

398
00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.344
Ted?

399
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:39.412
Hi.

400
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.583
I was just, uh...

401
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:49.056
Come on up.

402
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:51.925
MARSHALL:
He's in.

403
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.594
So...

404
00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:57.697
Ranjit, you must have done
it with a Lebanese girl?

405
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.067
Okay, that's
my Barney limit.

406
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.802
I'm gonna see if that bodega
has a bathroom.

407
00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.738
Actually,
I'm from Bangladesh.

408
00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:07.941
The women hot there?

409
00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:10.343
Here's a picture
of my wife.

410
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:15.415
A simple "no" would
have sufficed.

411
00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:18.418
She's lovely.

412
00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.087
So, Ted,

413
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.421
what brings you back
to Brooklyn

414
00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.856
at 1:00 in the morning
in a suit?

415
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.160
I was just hoping to...

416
00:15:27.194 --> 00:15:31.098
get those olives...
that you said I could have.

417
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:34.234
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

418
00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.669
Are you trying to get me drunk?

419
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.242
For starters.

420
00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:45.145
( romantic music plays )

421
00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:51.118
So, Marshall,
this olive theory,

422
00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:52.852
based on you and Lilly?

423
00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:53.820
Yeah.

424
00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:55.122
You hate olives.

425
00:15:55.155 --> 00:15:56.990
Lilly loves 'em.
You can't stand 'em.

426
00:15:57.024 --> 00:15:58.491
Yeah. Hate olives.

427
00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:00.493
Two weeks ago, Spanish bar
on 79th street,

428
00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:03.396
dish of olives, you had some--
what up?

429
00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:09.469
You have to swear that this
does not leave this cab.

430
00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:10.870
I swear.

431
00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.239
I swear.

432
00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:15.308
On our first date,

433
00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:16.609
I ordered a Greek salad.

434
00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:19.046
Lilly asked if she
could have my olives.

435
00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.714
I said, "Sure. I hate olives."

436
00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:23.250
But, you like olives.

437
00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:25.885
Well, I was 18, okay?
I was a virgin.

438
00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:29.422
Been waitin' my whole life for
a pretty girl to want my olives.

439
00:16:29.456 --> 00:16:32.925
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

440
00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:35.528
Don't get married.

441
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:43.136
* Baby, since I met you, oh...

442
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.538
I think I like
your olive theory.

443
00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:48.808
I think I like
your new French horn.

444
00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:52.345
I think I like your nose.

445
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.747
I think I'm
in love with you.

446
00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:55.782
What?!
What?!
What?!

447
00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:56.749
What?
What?

448
00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.085
What?

449
00:16:58.118 --> 00:16:59.219
Come on, man,
you said

450
00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:00.220
your stomach's been
hurting, right?

451
00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:01.388
You know what that is.

452
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:02.422
Hunger.

453
00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:03.823
You're hungry for experience.

454
00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.525
Hungry for something new.

455
00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:08.495
Hungry for olives.

456
00:17:08.528 --> 00:17:10.897
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

457
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.100
Yeah, I'm scared,
okay?

458
00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.235
But, when I think
of spending

459
00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:16.969
the rest of my life
with Lilly--

460
00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:20.773
committing, forever,
no other women--

461
00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:23.943
doesn't scare me at all.

462
00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.578
I'm marrying that girl.

463
00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:29.649
Lilly.

464
00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:31.751
Lilly, I like olives.

465
00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:34.121
We'll make it work.

466
00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:39.492
Aw...

467
00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:47.300
So, Orlando.

468
00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:49.236
You gonna
hit Disneyworld?

469
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.071
You love me?!

470
00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:54.674
I-I-I can't believe
I said that.

471
00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:55.775
Why did I say that?

472
00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:57.110
Who says that?

473
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.845
I should just go.

474
00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:00.113
Hold on.

475
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:01.414
Wait a minute.

476
00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:05.218
Promised you these.

477
00:18:05.252 --> 00:18:07.053
Olives.
Yeah.

478
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.888
Thanks. I love you.

479
00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.790
What is wrong
with me?

480
00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.960
Why are we still
sitting here?

481
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:15.395
Let's go. We can still
make last call.

482
00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:16.463
What do you say, Lil?

483
00:18:16.496 --> 00:18:19.532
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum?

484
00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.336
'Cause you're a pirate.

485
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.405
Okay, eye patch, gone.

486
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.375
And we can't just
abandon Ted.

487
00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:31.110
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

488
00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:32.945
It's been,
like, 20 minutes.

489
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:34.514
You think they're doin' it?

490
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:36.483
You think they're doin' it
in front of the dogs?

491
00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:37.484
Doggy style.
( laughing )

492
00:18:37.517 --> 00:18:38.951
Hey, there was
a girl in college,

493
00:18:38.985 --> 00:18:40.187
she had this golden
retriever...

494
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.054
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

495
00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:43.823
Hit it, Ranjit.

496
00:18:48.895 --> 00:18:51.130
So, when you tell
this story to your friends,

497
00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.799
could you avoid
the word "psycho?"

498
00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:55.868
I'd prefer... "eccentric."

499
00:18:55.902 --> 00:18:58.338
Good night... psycho.

500
00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:04.043
Great.

501
00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.912
Um, how do I get to the F train?

502
00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:08.415
Oh, um, two blocks

503
00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.250
that way and take a right.

504
00:19:13.186 --> 00:19:15.087
You know what?

505
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.657
I'm done being single.

506
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.692
I'm not good at it.

507
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:20.927
Look, obviously,

508
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.630
you can't tell a woman
you just met you love her.

509
00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:26.699
But...
it sucks that you can't.

510
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.369
I'll tell you something, though.

511
00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:32.439
If a woman-- not you, just some
hypothetical woman--

512
00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:35.107
were to bear with me
through all this,

513
00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:37.677
I think I'd make
a damn good husband.

514
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.347
Because, that's
the stuff I'd be good at,

515
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.350
stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father.

516
00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:46.519
And walking her five
hypothetical dogs.

517
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.656
Being a good kisser.

518
00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.759
Everyone thinks
they're a good kisser.

519
00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.394
Oh, I've got references.

520
00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:56.796
Good night, Ted.

521
00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.572
And I'm a good handshaker.

522
00:20:05.605 --> 00:20:07.907
That's a pretty
great handshake.

523
00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:13.313
And that was it.

524
00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:16.215
I'll probably
never see her again.

525
00:20:17.517 --> 00:20:18.318
What?

526
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:19.952
That was the signal.

527
00:20:19.986 --> 00:20:22.054
That long,
lingering handshake?

528
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:23.490
You should have kissed her.

529
00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:26.259
There's no such thing
as "the signal."

530
00:20:26.293 --> 00:20:28.528
But, yeah,
that was the signal.

531
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.830
Signal.

532
00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:32.832
Ah, Carl,
thank you.

533
00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.667
Something
I gotta do.

534
00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:37.036
By the way,

535
00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.471
you should have kissed her.

536
00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:41.007
Carl!
You guys weren't there.

537
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.642
( cork pops )

538
00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:45.044
I am so turned
on right now.

539
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:47.280
TED:
Guys, trust me.

540
00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.348
I've seen the signal.

541
00:20:48.381 --> 00:20:50.650
That was not the signal.

542
00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:52.952
Yeah, Ted, we're
not on you anymore.

543
00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:55.087
To my fiancÃ©e.

544
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:56.956
To the future.

545
00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:58.725
To one hell
of a night!

546
00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:04.731
That was not the signal.

547
00:21:04.764 --> 00:21:07.434
I asked her
about it years later.

548
00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:09.001
And, yeah, that was the signal.

549
00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:10.403
I could have kissed her.

550
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.171
But that's the funny
thing about destiny.

551
00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:14.574
It happens
whether you plan it or not.

552
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.709
I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again,

553
00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:19.512
but it turns out I was just
too close to the puzzle

554
00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:21.448
to see the picture
that was forming.

555
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:23.049
Because, that, kids,

556
00:21:23.082 --> 00:21:26.285
is the true story of how
I met your Aunt Robin.

557
00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:28.655
Aunt Robin?

558
00:21:28.688 --> 00:21:31.123
I thought this was
how you met Mom!

559
00:21:31.157 --> 00:21:32.224
Will you relax?

560
00:21:32.258 --> 00:21:33.993
I'm getting to it.

561
00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:37.530
Like I said, it's a long story.
