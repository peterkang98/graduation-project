00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.686
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China...

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.789
...than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.390
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:24.391
What would account for that?

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.494
An awful lot of people live in China,
but here's my question.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.997
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.835
...who all got 1600 on their SATs?

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.415
I didn't know they take SATs in China.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.058
They don't.
I wasn't talking about China anymore,

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:35.861
I was talking about me.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.538
- You got a 1600?
- Yes.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.573
I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.141
Does that mean you
got nothing wrong?

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.043
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.080
- Or you could get into a final club.
- Or I get into a final club.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.514
From a woman's perspective...

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.449
...sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:50.621
- This is serious.
- On the other hand...

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.021
- I do like guys who row crew.
- Well, I can't do that.

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.890
- I was kidding.
- Yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.759
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.794
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.130
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, delusional?

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:05.065
Sometimes you say two things at once.

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:06.700
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.702
But you've seen guys who row crew,
right?

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.003
No.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.005
Okay, well,
they're world-class athletes.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.708
You said you like guys who row crew,
I assumed you met one.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:18.479
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.280
Okay.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.982
Should we get something to eat?

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.018
Would you like to talk
about something else?

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:27.432
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club...

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.890
...I think I may have missed a birthday.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:32.993
There are really more people
in China with genius IQs than...

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.447
The Phoenix is most diverse.
The Fly Club. Roosevelt punched the Porc.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.263
Which one?

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.268
The Porcellian, the porc.
It's the best of the best.

00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:40.146
Which Roosevelt?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.101
Theodore.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.705
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls...

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.640
...who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.442
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.845
Okay, well,
which is the easiest to get into?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.849
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.985
None of them. That's the point.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.288
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer...

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:02.623
...and Eduardo won't come close
to getting in.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.858
The ability to make money
doesn't impress anybody here.

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.995
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.563
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.750
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.467
I think you asked me that...

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.534
...because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into...

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:17.224
...is the one
where I'll have the best chance.

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.939
I... What?

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:21.106
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into...

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:23.477
...because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:26.313
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one...

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.648
...where anybody has the best chance.

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.216
You didn't ask me
which one was the best...

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:30.817
...you asked me which one
was the easiest.

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.454
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:36.957
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.326
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:41.795
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about this...

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.664
...who will prescribe you medication.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.033
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.969
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs".

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.806
There's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.642
Yes. There is.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.477
That was cryptic,
so you do speak in code.

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:58.879
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:02.516
I need to do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.718
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.820
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.588
Teddy Roosevelt
didn't get elected president...

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.110
...because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:12.326
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:16.597
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:19.499
- Did you really just say that?
- I was kidding.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.201
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.402
I wanna be straightforward with you...

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.738
...and tell you I think you might
want to be more supportive.

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:28.408
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings...

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:32.546
...and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.281
You would do that for me?

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.150
We're dating.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.818
Okay.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.021
I wanna be straightforward with you...

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:42.923
...and let you know
that we're not anymore.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.526
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating. I'm sorry.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.528
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:50.097
- You're breaking up with me?
- You're gonna introduce me to people...

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.865
... I wouldn't normally have
the chance to to meet?

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.867
What is that supposed to mean?

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:55.202
- Settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.037
The reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now...

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.573
...is because you used to sleep
with the door guy.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:03.610
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:08.115
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:10.717
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:13.053
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.454
- Is this real?
- Yes.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.457
- Then I apologize.
- I have to go study.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:17.858
- Erica?
- Yes?

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.294
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.629
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's talk.

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:23.964
- I can't.
- Why?

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.767
It is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a Stair Master.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:28.936
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:30.470
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.773
I was saying you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.174
If it seemed rude, I apologize.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.509
- I have to study.
- You don't have to.

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:36.677
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:37.979
Because you go to BU.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:42.249
Do you want to get some food?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.986
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:47.754
I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat.
So we're even.

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.591
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.293
I was being polite. I have no intention
of being friends with you.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.162
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class...

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.965
...and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

00:04:58.032 --> 00:05:02.336
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.640
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you...

00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:07.208
...because you're a nerd.

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:11.679
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:15.282
It'll be because you're an asshole.

00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.032
Erica Albright's a bitch.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.969
Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht...

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:25.339
...or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:31.478
For the record,
she may look like a 34C...

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:34.214
...but she's getting all kinds of help
from Victoria's Secret.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:38.618
She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.224
The truth is, she has a nice face.

00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:46.593
I need to do something
to take my mind off her.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.329
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

00:08:55.502 --> 00:08:57.804
I'm a little intoxicated,
I'm not gonna lie.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.232
So what if it's not even 10pm...

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:01.073
- ...and it's Tuesday night?
- Billy.

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.543
The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop...

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.113
...and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:09.016
Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures...

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:12.086
...next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.

00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:13.888
Good call, Mr. Olson.

00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:22.101
Yeah, it's on.

00:09:22.462 --> 00:09:23.497
I'm not gonna do the farm animals...

00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:25.432
...but I like the idea
of comparing two people together.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.034
It gives the whole thing
a very "Turing" feel...

00:09:27.101 --> 00:09:28.969
...since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit...

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:31.605
...than, say, choosing a number
to represent each person's hotness...

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:33.307
...like they do on hotornot.com.

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:35.809
The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.212
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook...

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:39.346
...so I'm going to have to get
all the images...

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.916
...from the individual houses
that people are in.

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:44.151
Let the hacking begin.

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:01.268
First up is Kirkland.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:04.371
They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.

00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:06.607
So a little Wget magic
is all that's necessary...

00:10:06.674 --> 00:10:08.709
...to download
the entire Kirkland facebook.

00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:10.878
Kids' stuff.

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.562
Next is Eliot.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:31.799
They're also open, but with no indexes
on Apache. I can run an empty search...

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:34.368
...and it returns all of the images
in a single page.

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:37.771
And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.473
Excellent. Moving right along.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.975
Excuse me! Everybody!

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.479
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs...

00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:48.382
...not just at Harvard, but in the world.

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:49.484
And I want to welcome you all...

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.987
...to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

00:11:00.294 --> 00:11:03.363
Lowell has some security. They require
a user name/password combo...

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.532
...and I'm gonna go ahead
and say they don't have access...

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:06.133
...to the main F.A.S user database...

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.469
...so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.

00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:12.506
Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:16.677
All I need to do is break out the same
script I used on Lowell and we're set.

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:19.313
Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.682
Nothing I can do about that.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:23.183
Dunster is intense.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.953
Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:27.054
You have to do searches.

00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.672
If your search returns more than
20 matches, nothing gets returned.

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.022
And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:34.728
They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.

00:11:34.895 --> 00:11:36.396
This may be difficult. I'll come back later.

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:38.198
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.001
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:42.669
Leverett is better.
They make you search...

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:43.904
...but you can do an empty search...

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:45.873
...and get links to pages
with every picture.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.609
It's obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:50.410
There's no way
I'm going to go to 500 pages...

00:11:50.477 --> 00:11:51.652
...to download pics one at a time.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:55.283
So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.227
Here you go.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.534
Done.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.669
Hey, what's going on?

00:12:15.836 --> 00:12:19.406
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and
he's going to have the key ingredient.

00:12:19.573 --> 00:12:21.108
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:22.977
You and Erica split up.

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:24.378
How did you know that?

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:26.046
It's on your blog.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:28.615
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:31.084
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

00:12:31.285 --> 00:12:33.254
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

00:12:33.321 --> 00:12:35.356
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.893
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.728
You think this is such a good idea?

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:43.163
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.032
I need the algorithm.

00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.736
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:53.273
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.943
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win...

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.478
...based on their current rating. Right?

00:12:57.524 --> 00:13:00.861
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

00:13:01.248 --> 00:13:02.583
Let's write it.

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.166
One on the left.

00:13:19.633 --> 00:13:20.934
The right.

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.436
Yeah, still the right.

00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.338
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:25.606
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:28.642
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:29.943
The question is...

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:32.613
...who are they gonna send it to?

00:14:01.542 --> 00:14:02.910
Hey, guys, check this out.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.147
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.650
Look at these girls. Right or left?

00:14:09.817 --> 00:14:12.052
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:14.888
Right or left?

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:16.790
That's my roommate.

00:14:16.957 --> 00:14:18.825
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

00:14:20.327 --> 00:14:21.862
This is pathetic.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.331
- Right.
- Left.

00:14:24.898 --> 00:14:25.999
- Left.
- Left?

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:28.402
Oh, shit.

00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:30.571
Albright.

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:32.940
He blogged about you.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:35.409
You don't wanna read it.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.547
Left.

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.082
Latina.

00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:43.417
Erica.

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:45.719
Is this yours?

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:47.254
I stole it from a tranny.

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:49.423
Get the hell out of here!

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.059
- Left.
- One on the right.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.694
Left.

00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:02.870
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.274
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it
down before we get into trouble?

00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:17.317
Hello?

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:21.455
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:23.390
At 4 in the morning?

00:15:23.557 --> 00:15:26.627
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

00:15:26.927 --> 00:15:29.129
You're saying it's unusual
for 4 in the morning?

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.366
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.401
All right.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.705
I gotta go in.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:40.774
What's going on?

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:43.544
Harvard's network is about to crash.

00:15:49.683 --> 00:15:50.817
You don't think...

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:54.121
I do.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:57.024
Go see if it's everybody's.

00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:04.031
I can't connect.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:07.000
The network's down.

00:16:07.201 --> 00:16:09.503
Unless it's a coincidence,
I think this is us.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.305
It's not a coincidence.

00:16:11.705 --> 00:16:13.273
Holy shit.

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.012
So you were called
in front of the Ad Board.

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:20.181
That's not what happened.

00:16:20.348 --> 00:16:22.332
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:26.220
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.088
- Mark.
- That I said that stuff to her?

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.990
I was reading from
the transcript of her deposition.

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:31.625
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

00:16:31.692 --> 00:16:33.093
That's really for us to decide.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.564
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll settle.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.432
Why don't we stretch our legs?

00:16:38.599 --> 00:16:40.367
Can we do that? It's been three hours.

00:16:40.534 --> 00:16:44.004
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg...

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:45.639
...with the girl's testimony from the bar.

00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:47.341
I'm not embarrassed,
she made a lot of that up.

00:16:47.508 --> 00:16:48.709
She was under oath.

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:51.946
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.092
The site got 2,200 hits
within two hours?

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:07.828
- Thousand.
- What?

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:10.764
Twenty-two thousand.

00:17:31.084 --> 00:17:33.487
These guys are just freaking fast.

00:17:38.825 --> 00:17:41.562
Is there any way to make this
a fair fight?

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.430
Jump out and swim.

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.033
I think we'd have to jump out
and drown.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.169
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:52.506
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:53.707
Just row the damn boat.

00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:03.483
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.221
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.022
- Really?
- At 4 a.m.

00:18:09.323 --> 00:18:09.990
How?

00:18:10.157 --> 00:18:13.527
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:15.729
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

00:18:15.796 --> 00:18:16.563
I don't know.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.066
A three- hour low- rate
technical row before breakfast.

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:20.634
Full course load. Studying.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.870
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

00:18:23.137 --> 00:18:26.106
I'm not sure how we missed it. How
much activity was there on this thing?

00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:28.041
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:29.910
Twenty-two thousand?

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:32.446
Cam, this guy hacked the facebook
of seven houses.

00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:35.215
He set up the whole website in one night,
while drunk.

00:18:35.382 --> 00:18:36.483
Twenty-two thousand?

00:18:37.084 --> 00:18:40.621
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

00:18:41.088 --> 00:18:43.724
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.492
This is our guy.

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.461
Cameron Winklevoss.

00:18:47.628 --> 00:18:50.764
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:53.800
- "Cameron" spelled the usual way.
- Tyler Winklevoss.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:57.371
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:01.041
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

00:19:01.475 --> 00:19:04.311
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security...

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:05.812
...violating copyrights...

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:11.218
...violating individual privacy by creating
the website www.facemash.com.

00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:14.054
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy...

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:16.356
...on distribution of digitized images.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:19.593
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.827
Would you like to do so?

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:22.863
I...

00:19:23.564 --> 00:19:28.435
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW...

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:30.204
...to Fuerza Latina...

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.539
...and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted...

00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:34.808
...as I take it that they were.

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:37.945
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security...

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:40.948
...I believe I deserve some recognition
from this board.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:45.052
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:47.120
I don't understand.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:48.555
Which part?

00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:50.457
You deserve recognition?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.627
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:55.729
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.198
Mr. Zuckerberg...

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:01.502
...I'm in charge of security for all
computers on the Harvard network...

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.885
...and I can assure you
of its sophistication.

00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:08.208
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

00:20:08.375 --> 00:20:09.409
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

00:20:09.576 --> 00:20:11.746
That would be impressive except if you
had known what you were looking for...

00:20:11.813 --> 00:20:13.915
...you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.554
So?

00:20:20.721 --> 00:20:23.023
Six months academic probation.

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:25.292
Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

00:20:25.459 --> 00:20:26.960
They had my blog.

00:20:27.127 --> 00:20:28.862
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:30.230
That was stupid.

00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.400
But I was kidding.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:35.903
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:39.540
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:41.542
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:44.111
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said, I know.

00:20:44.278 --> 00:20:46.280
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:49.750
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address...

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:52.186
...and a page size of 256 bytes.

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:57.457
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

00:20:58.025 --> 00:21:00.894
Maybe you want DMA
on your 16-bit system. Who knows?

00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:04.498
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.901
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.771
The eight status bits would then be...?

00:21:10.938 --> 00:21:12.172
Anybody?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.843
And I see we have our first surrender.

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:17.211
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.413
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.451
One valid bit, one modified bit, one
reference bit and five permission bits.

00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:27.788
That is correct.

00:21:28.522 --> 00:21:30.757
Does everybody see
how he got there?

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:37.298
Mark?

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.634
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:42.903
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.472
- Tyler Winklevoss.
- Are you guys related?

00:21:45.639 --> 00:21:47.074
- That's good.
- Funny.

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:48.642
We never heard that before.

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:50.978
What can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.146
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:54.948
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

00:21:55.115 --> 00:21:58.151
No. We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:00.487
You got a minute?

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:03.624
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.225
- We have to.
- Why?

00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:06.793
We row crew.

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:09.696
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

00:22:14.701 --> 00:22:16.670
- You ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

00:22:16.837 --> 00:22:18.372
We can't take you past the bike room...

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.074
- ...because you're not a member.
- I've heard.

00:22:23.844 --> 00:22:26.813
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.549
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

00:22:28.715 --> 00:22:30.651
- This is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

00:22:30.817 --> 00:22:32.586
We were really impressed
with Facemash.

00:22:32.753 --> 00:22:35.222
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

00:22:35.389 --> 00:22:36.157
I don't know CourseMatch.

00:22:36.323 --> 00:22:38.459
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

00:22:38.826 --> 00:22:40.427
It's really smart, man.

00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:43.830
- Mark.
- Yeah.

00:22:43.997 --> 00:22:45.732
We were talking about CourseMatch.

00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:48.735
It was kind of a no-brainer.

00:22:48.902 --> 00:22:51.005
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

00:22:51.272 --> 00:22:54.575
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:56.376
Anybody try to buy it?

00:22:56.977 --> 00:22:58.011
Microsoft.

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.180
How much?

00:23:00.347 --> 00:23:02.349
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:04.151
- For free?
- Yeah.

00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:05.419
Why?

00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:09.756
Well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while...

00:23:09.923 --> 00:23:10.958
...and we think it's great.

00:23:11.124 --> 00:23:12.392
It's called the Harvard Connection.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:15.596
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

00:23:15.663 --> 00:23:17.898
People can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

00:23:18.365 --> 00:23:21.435
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

00:23:24.037 --> 00:23:25.706
Harvard.edu.

00:23:25.873 --> 00:23:28.308
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country.

00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:30.711
The whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:32.613
Not to put anything indelicately...

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:34.448
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:37.050
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

00:23:37.217 --> 00:23:40.420
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster...

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:41.922
...or any of those other
social networking sites...

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:44.791
Is exclusivity. Right?

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:46.627
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:23:46.793 --> 00:23:48.195
We'd love for you to work with us.

00:23:48.362 --> 00:23:49.963
We need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:51.698
We know
you've been taking it in the shins.

00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:54.701
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:57.638
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

00:23:57.804 --> 00:24:00.274
You would do that for me?

00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:03.911
We'd like to work with you.

00:24:04.077 --> 00:24:07.080
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:09.750
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:13.020
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

00:24:13.187 --> 00:24:14.454
I'm in.

00:24:15.856 --> 00:24:17.024
What?

00:24:18.091 --> 00:24:19.126
I'm in.

00:24:19.593 --> 00:24:20.627
Awesome.

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:22.296
That's what you said?

00:24:22.963 --> 00:24:25.432
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

00:24:25.499 --> 00:24:26.967
When did you come to Eduardo?

00:24:27.434 --> 00:24:28.736
I don't understand that question.

00:24:28.803 --> 00:24:31.005
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

00:24:31.672 --> 00:24:32.706
The affirmative?

00:24:32.873 --> 00:24:35.142
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

00:24:35.309 --> 00:24:37.010
It was called The Facebook then.

00:24:37.177 --> 00:24:39.146
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

00:24:39.646 --> 00:24:41.682
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:43.150
Did you answer affirmatively...

00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:45.686
...when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra...

00:24:45.853 --> 00:24:47.354
...asked you
to build Harvard Connection?

00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:49.156
Did you say yes?

00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:51.692
I said I'd help.

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:55.195
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:56.663
I wouldn't say I approached him.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.932
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:01.435
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

00:25:01.602 --> 00:25:02.870
What's that?

00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:04.972
The Jewish fraternity.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.641
It was Caribbean Night.

00:25:25.025 --> 00:25:27.594
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

00:25:27.661 --> 00:25:30.497
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:32.833
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection...

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.735
...between Jewish guys
and Asian girls.

00:25:35.002 --> 00:25:38.038
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart...

00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:41.008
...they're not Jewish,
and they can't dance.

00:25:41.175 --> 00:25:42.209
Hey, Mark's here.

00:25:42.476 --> 00:25:43.644
Mark!

00:25:47.014 --> 00:25:48.549
Be right back.

00:25:56.222 --> 00:25:57.090
I think I've come up with something.

00:25:57.257 --> 00:25:59.393
I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.494
What?

00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:02.930
I got punched by the Phoenix.

00:26:04.164 --> 00:26:05.199
- Are you kidding?
- No.

00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:07.601
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process...

00:26:07.768 --> 00:26:10.504
...but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:12.439
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

00:26:12.606 --> 00:26:13.740
So...

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:16.010
You got punched by the Phoenix.

00:26:16.176 --> 00:26:19.113
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:21.582
It was a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

00:26:21.748 --> 00:26:23.383
What did you wanna talk to me about?

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.818
- Mark?
- Yeah.

00:26:24.985 --> 00:26:26.053
You said you'd come up
with something.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.755
Yeah, I think I've come up with
something. Come outside and let's talk.

00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:30.123
It's 20 degrees outside.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.192
I can't stare at that loop
of Niagara Falls...

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:35.195
...which has absolutely nothing
to do with the Caribbean.

00:26:46.273 --> 00:26:48.108
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

00:26:48.475 --> 00:26:49.075
Yeah.

00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:50.644
It wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:52.613
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.680
- Yeah.
- It was because...

00:26:53.714 --> 00:26:56.550
...they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

00:26:57.217 --> 00:26:58.952
People want to
check out their friends.

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:00.719
So why not build a website
that offers that?

00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:03.791
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:05.659
Browse around. Maybe it's someone
you just met at a party.

00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:07.961
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

00:27:08.128 --> 00:27:13.500
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

00:27:13.934 --> 00:27:16.103
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.871
I'm totally psyched about this.
But, Wardo?

00:27:17.938 --> 00:27:18.972
Yeah?

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:21.141
"It would be exclusive."

00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:24.178
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

00:27:24.344 --> 00:27:26.180
Like getting punched.

00:27:27.114 --> 00:27:27.814
Now, that's good.

00:27:27.815 --> 00:27:30.484
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:33.387
I told him I thought it sounded great.

00:27:34.454 --> 00:27:35.689
It was a great idea.

00:27:35.856 --> 00:27:36.990
There was nothing to hack.

00:27:37.057 --> 00:27:40.194
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.965
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

00:27:45.432 --> 00:27:48.902
See, in a world where
social structure was everything...

00:27:49.703 --> 00:27:51.004
...that was the thing.

00:27:51.538 --> 00:27:52.840
It was a big project...

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:55.909
...and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code...

00:27:56.076 --> 00:27:58.612
...so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates...

00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:01.715
...Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

00:28:01.882 --> 00:28:05.519
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:07.221
So that was why.

00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:08.956
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:11.024
We'll split it, 70/30.

00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:13.560
Seventy for me, thirty for you
for putting up the $1,000...

00:28:13.727 --> 00:28:15.963
...and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:17.064
And you said?

00:28:17.231 --> 00:28:18.765
I said, "Let's do it."

00:28:18.932 --> 00:28:20.967
Okay. Did he add anything else?

00:28:21.501 --> 00:28:22.536
Yes.

00:28:25.939 --> 00:28:28.542
It probably was a diversity thing.

00:28:29.743 --> 00:28:30.911
But so what?

00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:32.246
Why do you think he said that?

00:28:32.313 --> 00:28:34.681
Gretchen, whose discovery is this?

00:28:34.748 --> 00:28:37.100
- If you'll let me continue my line of...
- What are you suggesting?

00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:39.887
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix...

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.602
...and began a plan
to screw him out of a company...

00:28:41.622 --> 00:28:43.190
- ...I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:44.591
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

00:28:44.758 --> 00:28:46.958
- Stop typing. We're off the record.
- I know you've done your homework...

00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:48.762
...and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

00:28:48.929 --> 00:28:50.964
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street...

00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:54.201
...take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:00.407
I'll let you know how the party is.

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:09.550
We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook...

00:29:09.716 --> 00:29:12.186
- ...and a witness in another.
- Yes, sir.

00:29:12.252 --> 00:29:15.189
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea...

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:17.758
...did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss...

00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:20.227
...Divya Narendra
or Harvard Connection?

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:22.963
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site...

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.967
...but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

00:29:27.134 --> 00:29:28.635
He said even
his most pathetic friends...

00:29:28.802 --> 00:29:32.606
...knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:34.608
"These guys", meaning my clients.

00:29:34.775 --> 00:29:38.645
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought...

00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:41.465
...that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

00:29:41.582 --> 00:29:43.217
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:46.153
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers...

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.922
...he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

00:29:49.089 --> 00:29:51.525
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

00:29:51.592 --> 00:29:54.061
Were you aware that while Mr.
Zuckerberg was building The Facebook...

00:29:54.128 --> 00:29:56.230
...he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

00:29:56.297 --> 00:29:58.632
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:03.003
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' site.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.339
- How would you know? You weren't there.
- Ty.

00:30:05.672 --> 00:30:08.742
Were you aware that while
Mr. Zuckerberg was building The Facebook...

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:12.079
...he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

00:30:12.246 --> 00:30:13.814
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

00:30:13.981 --> 00:30:16.617
We are about to find it in evidence.

00:30:17.118 --> 00:30:19.286
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler Winklevoss.

00:30:19.653 --> 00:30:21.488
November 30th, 2003.

00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:24.358
"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection.

00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:26.994
And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.798
So we can talk about it after I get all the
basic functionality up tomorrow night."

00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:36.303
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron
Winklevoss. December 1st, 2003.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.873
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just
got about three of your missed calls.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.809
I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."

00:30:42.976 --> 00:30:45.079
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

00:30:45.246 --> 00:30:47.381
December 10, 2003.

00:30:48.048 --> 00:30:50.684
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work...

00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:53.487
...so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."

00:30:53.654 --> 00:30:55.723
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.560
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

00:30:59.726 --> 00:31:00.894
Tell him okay...

00:31:01.061 --> 00:31:04.064
...but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:06.900
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

00:31:38.065 --> 00:31:38.832
Hey, Mark.

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:41.902
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

00:31:42.069 --> 00:31:43.504
It's gonna cost a little more money.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.106
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:48.709
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:53.914
- Do it.
- I already did.

00:31:58.352 --> 00:31:59.486
Hey, guess what?

00:32:00.888 --> 00:32:02.523
I made the second cut.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.424
That's good.

00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:08.595
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.368
I'll get out of here.

00:32:14.535 --> 00:32:16.904
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss...

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.274
...and Divya Narendra.
December 15th, 2003.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.773
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with...

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.480
...and it should be about 15 hours
of coding, so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

00:32:26.647 --> 00:32:29.917
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:32.119
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

00:32:32.286 --> 00:32:35.355
I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

00:32:35.522 --> 00:32:40.127
"Won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

00:32:44.264 --> 00:32:48.635
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

00:32:48.802 --> 00:32:51.104
It's also called
the Statue of Three Lies.

00:32:51.872 --> 00:32:54.007
What are the three lies?

00:32:54.675 --> 00:32:55.743
Mr. Dowd.

00:32:56.109 --> 00:32:58.145
The three lies. First...

00:32:58.712 --> 00:32:59.412
Shit!

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.232
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:03.684
Mr. Saverin.

00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:07.321
One, Harvard was founded
in 1636, not 1638.

00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:09.656
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

00:33:09.723 --> 00:33:12.626
- And three, that is not John Harvard.
- Who is it?

00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:17.030
It's a friend of the sculptor,
Daniel Chester.

00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:19.099
Keep your jacket on.

00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:26.473
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients...

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.910
...and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

00:33:30.077 --> 00:33:32.846
But on January 11th, 2004...

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.750
...Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook...

00:33:36.917 --> 00:33:39.686
...via Network Solutions.

00:33:40.854 --> 00:33:44.825
To the best of your knowledge, had he
even begun work on Harvard Connection?

00:33:45.993 --> 00:33:48.028
Not to my knowledge. No.

00:33:52.332 --> 00:33:54.434
What in the world is this?

00:33:55.569 --> 00:33:59.606
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
we have enough functionality in the site...

00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:02.342
...to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary...

00:34:02.543 --> 00:34:05.045
...to get a site like this to run"?

00:34:05.579 --> 00:34:06.980
"We'll speak soon"?

00:34:09.249 --> 00:34:11.852
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

00:34:12.019 --> 00:34:12.686
Yes, it was.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.538
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return...

00:34:17.758 --> 00:34:20.210
...and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

00:34:20.327 --> 00:34:21.395
That's correct.

00:34:21.562 --> 00:34:24.164
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

00:34:24.331 --> 00:34:26.266
- Do you see your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.901
Did I use any of your code?

00:34:28.068 --> 00:34:30.334
- You stole our whole goddamn idea.
- Fellas.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.630
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?
- Can I continue with my deposition?

00:34:33.773 --> 00:34:35.477
You know, you really don't
need a forensics team...

00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:36.443
...to get to the bottom of this.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.213
If you guys were the inventors
of Facebook...

00:34:39.646 --> 00:34:41.648
...you'd have invented Facebook.

00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:45.285
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

00:34:45.452 --> 00:34:46.720
No shit.

00:34:48.155 --> 00:34:49.489
Let's continue.

00:34:51.158 --> 00:34:53.627
February 4, 2004.

00:34:57.231 --> 00:34:58.398
Mark.

00:34:59.132 --> 00:35:00.267
Mark.

00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:04.238
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

00:35:04.404 --> 00:35:06.740
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

00:35:07.708 --> 00:35:09.910
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

00:35:11.278 --> 00:35:15.048
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

00:35:15.115 --> 00:35:16.483
Dustin.

00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:21.788
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

00:35:25.926 --> 00:35:27.094
Mark?

00:35:53.687 --> 00:35:55.889
We were supposed to meet at 9.

00:35:56.056 --> 00:35:58.725
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

00:35:58.892 --> 00:36:00.027
What?

00:36:11.205 --> 00:36:13.307
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

00:36:13.473 --> 00:36:14.675
It's clean and simple.

00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:17.511
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:20.647
What'd you write?

00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:23.650
"Relationship Status."
"Interested In."

00:36:23.817 --> 00:36:26.653
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.023
It's why people take certain classes and
sit where they sit and do what they do.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.860
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

00:36:34.127 --> 00:36:36.463
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon...

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.597
...there's a chance
they're actually gonna...

00:36:37.664 --> 00:36:39.733
- Gonna get laid.
- Meet a girl. Yes.

00:36:40.334 --> 00:36:42.436
- That is really good.
- And that was it.

00:36:42.603 --> 00:36:43.804
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:45.940
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.509
And here's the masthead.

00:36:48.675 --> 00:36:50.043
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.514
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.766
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

00:36:55.782 --> 00:36:57.084
Sure I do.

00:36:59.586 --> 00:37:01.622
So when's it going live?

00:37:02.222 --> 00:37:04.625
Right now. Get your laptop out.

00:37:05.292 --> 00:37:07.361
What? Why do we need my laptop?

00:37:07.528 --> 00:37:10.998
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

00:37:14.535 --> 00:37:18.539
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

00:37:18.705 --> 00:37:21.341
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

00:37:21.508 --> 00:37:23.711
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:24.929
I haven't gotten in yet.

00:37:25.345 --> 00:37:28.348
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

00:37:30.184 --> 00:37:31.385
- Sure.
- Good.

00:37:32.586 --> 00:37:33.420
Give me the mailing list.

00:37:33.587 --> 00:37:35.856
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

00:37:36.223 --> 00:37:38.325
These guys.
Yeah, they're literary geniuses...

00:37:38.492 --> 00:37:40.527
...because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

00:37:40.594 --> 00:37:42.096
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

00:37:42.463 --> 00:37:43.964
Yeah, you're right.

00:37:51.071 --> 00:37:52.606
The site's live.

00:37:53.507 --> 00:37:55.742
You know,
let's go get a drink and celebrate.

00:37:57.244 --> 00:37:58.645
I'm buying.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.248
Mark.

00:38:04.017 --> 00:38:05.419
Mark, are you praying?

00:38:19.132 --> 00:38:21.301
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

00:38:21.468 --> 00:38:23.504
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:24.838
Good point.

00:38:25.005 --> 00:38:28.475
Because Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

00:38:31.445 --> 00:38:33.814
Honey, you should put
your laptop away.

00:38:33.981 --> 00:38:35.849
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:37.518
- KC.
- What is it?

00:38:37.684 --> 00:38:38.552
I don't know.

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:40.688
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler...

00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:43.223
...because I can never get enough
of that.

00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.793
No, it's not.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.697
Div!

00:38:52.299 --> 00:38:53.467
What?

00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:00.573
This isn't mine.

00:39:01.008 --> 00:39:02.042
Okay, what is wrong?

00:39:05.045 --> 00:39:07.481
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

00:39:21.695 --> 00:39:22.829
Hey!

00:39:24.264 --> 00:39:25.132
Hey!

00:39:25.299 --> 00:39:26.333
Not now!

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.534
We need 20 minutes!

00:39:28.201 --> 00:39:29.036
Okay.

00:39:30.204 --> 00:39:33.373
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

00:39:34.975 --> 00:39:36.643
Mark Zuckerberg?

00:39:37.077 --> 00:39:38.912
He stole our website.

00:39:39.746 --> 00:39:42.549
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:48.956
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

00:39:49.222 --> 00:39:51.892
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:53.097
"Welcome to The Facebook.

00:39:53.193 --> 00:39:54.795
The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people...

00:39:54.962 --> 00:39:56.363
...through different social networks.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.600
You must have a harvard.edu address
to register."

00:39:59.766 --> 00:40:02.102
I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

00:40:02.269 --> 00:40:03.570
He's actually quoted a couple times.

00:40:03.737 --> 00:40:04.738
I can read it to you.

00:40:04.905 --> 00:40:07.908
"'Everyone's been talking about
a universal facebook,' he says."

00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.109
"He" meaning Mark.

00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.844
"'It's silly that
it would take the university...

00:40:11.011 --> 00:40:12.279
...a couple of years to get around to it.

00:40:12.546 --> 00:40:15.015
I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week.'"

00:40:15.182 --> 00:40:16.483
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.552
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:20.621
"As of yesterday evening,
Zuckerberg said...

00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:24.458
...over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com.

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.193
He said he anticipated
that 900 students...

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.128
...would have joined the site
by this morning."

00:40:28.195 --> 00:40:31.365
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

00:40:31.632 --> 00:40:35.802
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:39.406
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:40.974
That's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:42.976
We'll put all this together
and e-mail it to you.

00:40:43.143 --> 00:40:45.646
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

00:40:45.812 --> 00:40:48.015
Because you don't have a Harvard...

00:40:48.182 --> 00:40:50.417
It would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

00:40:50.884 --> 00:40:51.752
I'm sure you're right.

00:40:51.818 --> 00:40:54.588
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

00:40:56.156 --> 00:40:57.191
...what he did.

00:40:58.125 --> 00:40:59.960
All right, thank you very much.
And, Dad...

00:41:00.127 --> 00:41:01.161
All right, love you too.

00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:03.797
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

00:41:03.864 --> 00:41:04.999
We know he stole our idea.

00:41:05.165 --> 00:41:06.600
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:08.836
- He never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

00:41:09.002 --> 00:41:12.339
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts and
he gave himself a 42-day head start...

00:41:12.506 --> 00:41:14.441
...because he knows
what apparently you don't.

00:41:14.608 --> 00:41:16.276
Getting there first is everything.

00:41:16.443 --> 00:41:17.778
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

00:41:17.945 --> 00:41:20.914
I don't think you need to school me in
getting there first. Thank you.

00:41:21.248 --> 00:41:23.283
- That was your father's lawyer?
- His in-house counsel.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.285
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate...

00:41:25.452 --> 00:41:27.521
- ...he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.
- What's that gonna do?

00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:28.956
What, do you wanna sue him?

00:41:29.122 --> 00:41:32.192
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

00:41:32.359 --> 00:41:33.527
- We don't have to do that.
- Right.

00:41:33.694 --> 00:41:36.830
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5'', 220, and there's two of me.

00:41:36.997 --> 00:41:38.031
- I'm with this guy.
- Whatever.

00:41:38.198 --> 00:41:40.367
Let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

00:41:40.534 --> 00:41:42.536
How much more information
are you waiting for?

00:41:42.703 --> 00:41:45.472
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails...

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:47.140
...we can prove he looked at the code.

00:41:47.307 --> 00:41:50.310
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

00:41:50.477 --> 00:41:52.646
- On the home page?
- On every page.

00:41:52.813 --> 00:41:55.482
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

00:41:55.549 --> 00:41:56.583
Okay, look, we don't know...

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.886
They wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options...

00:41:59.052 --> 00:42:00.554
...would help restore his reputation...

00:42:00.721 --> 00:42:03.657
...following student outrage
over facemash.com."

00:42:03.824 --> 00:42:07.094
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:09.830
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this over...

00:42:09.997 --> 00:42:12.332
...we can at least get something
in the paper so people know...

00:42:12.499 --> 00:42:14.001
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.

00:42:14.067 --> 00:42:16.069
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

00:42:16.236 --> 00:42:17.571
And we're not suing anybody.

00:42:17.738 --> 00:42:19.039
Why not?

00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:22.976
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

00:42:24.144 --> 00:42:25.913
He's gonna say it's stupid.

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:28.649
- What, who, me?
- Say it. Why not?

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.186
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

00:42:32.352 --> 00:42:36.657
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

00:42:37.324 --> 00:42:40.194
You thought he was gonna be the
only one who thought that was stupid?

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.996
During the time when you say
you had this idea...

00:42:43.664 --> 00:42:47.167
...did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:49.269
"A family of means"?

00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:50.938
Did you know their father was wealthy?

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:53.440
I'm not sure why you're asking.

00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.576
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

00:42:55.743 --> 00:42:57.711
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

00:42:58.979 --> 00:43:00.781
Did you know
that they came from money?

00:43:00.948 --> 00:43:02.783
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.885
In one of your e-mails
to Mr. Narendra...

00:43:05.052 --> 00:43:08.288
...you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

00:43:08.455 --> 00:43:09.623
If you say so.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:13.460
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

00:43:13.627 --> 00:43:15.796
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members...

00:43:15.963 --> 00:43:18.232
...of a Harvard final club
called the Porcellian.

00:43:18.398 --> 00:43:19.366
They pointed that out.

00:43:19.433 --> 00:43:21.802
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

00:43:21.869 --> 00:43:25.872
Please. So it's safe to say you were
aware that my clients had money.

00:43:27.774 --> 00:43:28.508
Yes.

00:43:28.575 --> 00:43:29.910
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:33.413
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture...

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.082
...you didn't ask my clients for it.

00:43:35.249 --> 00:43:37.718
They had demonstrated an interest
to you in that kind of thing.

00:43:37.885 --> 00:43:40.821
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

00:43:40.988 --> 00:43:43.423
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association...

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.492
...and he was also my best friend.

00:43:46.326 --> 00:43:49.963
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

00:43:50.497 --> 00:43:52.533
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.069
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

00:43:55.235 --> 00:43:57.504
Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

00:43:57.704 --> 00:43:59.306
- They're best friends.
- Not anymore.

00:43:59.473 --> 00:44:01.375
Well, we already went through this.
Never mind.

00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:04.144
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:05.646
It exploded.

00:44:05.812 --> 00:44:07.548
Everybody on campus was using it.

00:44:07.714 --> 00:44:11.285
"Facebook me" was a common
expression after two weeks.

00:44:11.685 --> 00:44:12.719
And Mark?

00:44:12.886 --> 00:44:14.821
And Mark was the biggest thing
on a campus...

00:44:14.988 --> 00:44:16.657
...that included 19 Nobel laureates...

00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:21.295
...15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

00:44:21.461 --> 00:44:22.996
Who was the movie star?

00:44:23.163 --> 00:44:24.698
Does it matter?

00:44:25.098 --> 00:44:26.133
No.

00:44:28.435 --> 00:44:32.239
...at Out of Town News and picked up that
copy of Popular Electronics magazine...

00:44:32.406 --> 00:44:34.541
...with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

00:44:34.608 --> 00:44:37.044
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

00:44:37.211 --> 00:44:39.179
He brought that magazine
and showed it to me and said,

00:44:39.346 --> 00:44:43.150
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

00:44:43.317 --> 00:44:46.453
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.857
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

00:44:50.023 --> 00:44:52.226
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

00:44:52.392 --> 00:44:56.563
That kit computer on the cover of that
magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:00.834
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

00:45:01.368 --> 00:45:05.272
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes...

00:45:05.439 --> 00:45:10.144
...but I also had to leave room for the
users to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

00:45:11.112 --> 00:45:13.414
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:14.848
Yeah.

00:45:15.015 --> 00:45:17.184
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

00:45:17.518 --> 00:45:19.786
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

00:45:19.953 --> 00:45:21.755
Yeah, we... Yes.

00:45:21.922 --> 00:45:23.056
Cool.

00:45:23.357 --> 00:45:24.691
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

00:45:24.858 --> 00:45:25.893
Hi.

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:28.228
Well, very nice to meet you.

00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:30.130
Facebook me when you get home.

00:45:30.197 --> 00:45:32.232
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

00:45:32.499 --> 00:45:33.534
Certainly.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.536
Absolutely do that.

00:45:42.242 --> 00:45:45.245
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"...

00:45:45.512 --> 00:45:47.080
...which is stunningly great
for two reasons.

00:45:47.247 --> 00:45:49.883
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well...

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.084
- They wanna have drinks later.
- Yes.

00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:52.686
Have you ever heard
so many good things...

00:45:52.853 --> 00:45:54.455
...packed into one
regular-sized sentence?

00:45:54.522 --> 00:45:55.790
Excuse me, Mark?

00:45:56.723 --> 00:45:57.758
Yeah?

00:45:57.925 --> 00:45:59.726
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

00:46:00.394 --> 00:46:01.428
Sure.

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:03.630
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

00:46:04.197 --> 00:46:04.932
Thanks.

00:46:05.098 --> 00:46:06.767
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

00:46:06.934 --> 00:46:08.435
I could swear he was looking at you...

00:46:08.602 --> 00:46:11.572
...when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

00:46:11.738 --> 00:46:13.140
I doubt it.

00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:15.809
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:18.745
It was Bill Gates.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.982
Shit, that makes sense.

00:46:22.816 --> 00:46:24.918
All right. Thanks, guys.

00:46:27.354 --> 00:46:29.089
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

00:46:29.256 --> 00:46:31.058
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you?

00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:32.793
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.295
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.465
It's time to monetize the thing.

00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:39.833
What were their names?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.735
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

00:46:41.902 --> 00:46:43.937
I said, it's time to monetize the site.

00:46:44.838 --> 00:46:45.906
What does that mean?

00:46:46.073 --> 00:46:48.809
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:51.979
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

00:46:52.613 --> 00:46:54.281
- Advertising.
- No.

00:46:54.681 --> 00:46:56.783
Well, we got 4,000 members.

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.151
Because The Facebook is cool...

00:46:58.318 --> 00:47:01.455
...and if we start installing pop-ups for
Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

00:47:01.622 --> 00:47:03.023
I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.359
I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

00:47:05.526 --> 00:47:08.662
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

00:47:09.029 --> 00:47:11.198
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

00:47:11.265 --> 00:47:12.533
We know that it is cool.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.235
That is a priceless asset
I'm not giving up.

00:47:15.302 --> 00:47:17.404
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

00:47:17.571 --> 00:47:19.073
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.275
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

00:47:21.342 --> 00:47:22.943
You're talking about fashion? You?

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.746
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

00:47:25.813 --> 00:47:28.816
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:32.019
Mark, what is this?

00:47:32.186 --> 00:47:33.387
- What?
- This.

00:47:33.554 --> 00:47:35.756
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

00:47:35.823 --> 00:47:36.857
- Who?
- The girls.

00:47:37.224 --> 00:47:37.992
When did you get this?

00:47:38.059 --> 00:47:40.261
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

00:47:40.627 --> 00:47:42.763
- Jesus Christ.
- The girls. What were their names?

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:45.666
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

00:47:45.832 --> 00:47:47.735
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

00:47:47.902 --> 00:47:50.971
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

00:47:51.538 --> 00:47:52.739
Why didn't you show this to me?

00:47:52.906 --> 00:47:54.341
It was addressed to me.

00:47:54.508 --> 00:47:57.444
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Narendra and the Winklevosses.

00:47:57.511 --> 00:47:58.444
I know what it says.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:00.314
- Did we?
- Did we what?

00:48:00.381 --> 00:48:02.650
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

00:48:03.016 --> 00:48:04.785
The letter says
we could face legal action.

00:48:04.952 --> 00:48:06.753
No, it says I could face legal action.

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.949
This is from a lawyer.
They must feel they have grounds.

00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:11.992
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:15.062
The grounds are our thing is cool and
popular and Harvard Connection is lame.

00:48:15.229 --> 00:48:17.431
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

00:48:17.598 --> 00:48:18.632
I didn't use anything.

00:48:18.799 --> 00:48:20.401
A guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money...

00:48:20.567 --> 00:48:22.269
...to everyone who ever
has built a chair.

00:48:22.436 --> 00:48:24.171
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

00:48:24.338 --> 00:48:27.274
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

00:48:29.276 --> 00:48:30.444
Okay.

00:48:31.645 --> 00:48:37.284
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

00:48:37.618 --> 00:48:40.053
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.624
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

00:48:44.091 --> 00:48:45.192
No.

00:48:48.462 --> 00:48:49.963
What are we doing about this?

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.467
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

00:48:53.634 --> 00:48:54.735
And what did you say?

00:48:54.902 --> 00:48:57.938
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

00:48:58.105 --> 00:49:00.407
Where it stood with graphics,
how much programming was left...

00:49:00.574 --> 00:49:01.809
...that I had not anticipated."

00:49:01.975 --> 00:49:04.144
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use...

00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:07.581
...the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

00:49:07.748 --> 00:49:11.251
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

00:49:11.418 --> 00:49:12.753
I'd raised concerns before.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.288
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

00:49:14.454 --> 00:49:18.425
I'm talking about at the meeting in January
to which this letter is referring.

00:49:18.592 --> 00:49:21.528
- Yeah.
- Let me rephrase this.

00:49:21.828 --> 00:49:26.266
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the
first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

00:49:26.433 --> 00:49:27.534
Is that a question?

00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:31.038
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

00:49:31.205 --> 00:49:33.874
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:37.077
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

00:49:37.244 --> 00:49:39.012
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:40.347
It just started raining.

00:49:40.514 --> 00:49:43.584
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:45.485
No.

00:49:46.587 --> 00:49:47.955
Do you think I deserve it?

00:49:48.555 --> 00:49:49.389
What?

00:49:49.456 --> 00:49:52.326
Do you think I deserve
your full attention?

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.695
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition...

00:49:54.862 --> 00:49:58.265
...and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

00:49:58.432 --> 00:50:02.069
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

00:50:02.135 --> 00:50:05.105
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall...

00:50:05.172 --> 00:50:06.240
...they have a right to try...

00:50:06.307 --> 00:50:09.543
...but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

00:50:10.911 --> 00:50:13.247
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:16.517
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook...

00:50:16.683 --> 00:50:18.852
...where my colleagues and I are
doing things that no one in this room...

00:50:19.019 --> 00:50:20.454
...including and especially your clients...

00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:24.024
...are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

00:50:24.892 --> 00:50:27.828
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

00:50:34.802 --> 00:50:38.605
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

00:50:40.307 --> 00:50:41.808
Back at 2:30.

00:50:42.676 --> 00:50:44.745
So, what were their names?

00:50:46.346 --> 00:50:48.549
Their names were Christy and Alice...

00:50:51.018 --> 00:50:53.654
...and they wanna have drinks tonight.

00:50:55.856 --> 00:50:59.159
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

00:51:18.378 --> 00:51:19.780
Oh, my God.

00:51:20.714 --> 00:51:22.216
I don't care.

00:51:44.204 --> 00:51:45.405
Hey, man, sorry.

00:51:46.473 --> 00:51:48.408
A couple girls are freshening up
in there.

00:51:49.576 --> 00:51:50.811
Sweet.

00:51:55.249 --> 00:51:56.950
We have groupies.

00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:06.727
I'll be right back.

00:52:06.894 --> 00:52:08.629
Mark, where you going? Mark.

00:52:13.867 --> 00:52:14.935
Erica?

00:52:16.803 --> 00:52:17.638
Hi.

00:52:17.805 --> 00:52:20.541
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club.

00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:22.376
- First time.
- Mine too.

00:52:23.043 --> 00:52:25.179
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

00:52:25.612 --> 00:52:26.780
I think I'm good right here.

00:52:27.047 --> 00:52:30.784
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

00:52:30.851 --> 00:52:32.086
Right here is fine.

00:52:33.253 --> 00:52:35.122
I don't know if you heard about
this website I launched.

00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:36.223
No.

00:52:37.057 --> 00:52:39.793
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.495
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

00:52:41.662 --> 00:52:43.897
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:45.632
Comparing women to farm animals.

00:52:46.033 --> 00:52:47.267
I didn't end up doing that.

00:52:47.434 --> 00:52:49.003
It didn't stop you from writing it.

00:52:49.369 --> 00:52:52.105
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever...

00:52:52.272 --> 00:52:54.308
...it would be a crime
for it not to be shared.

00:52:55.876 --> 00:52:58.478
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink...

00:52:58.645 --> 00:53:01.381
...and you published that
Erica Albright was a bitch...

00:53:01.548 --> 00:53:04.618
...right before you made some
ignorant crack about my family's name...

00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:05.853
...my bra size...

00:53:06.019 --> 00:53:08.656
...and then rated women
based on their hotness.

00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:11.659
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

00:53:12.192 --> 00:53:14.294
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room...

00:53:14.361 --> 00:53:17.097
...because that's what the angry
do nowadays.

00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:20.100
I was nice to you.
Don't torture me for it.

00:53:20.267 --> 00:53:21.969
If we could just go somewhere
for a minute...

00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:24.438
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

00:53:24.605 --> 00:53:25.706
Okay.

00:53:25.873 --> 00:53:27.007
Okay.

00:53:28.775 --> 00:53:31.111
Good luck with your video game.

00:53:31.278 --> 00:53:33.147
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

00:53:33.314 --> 00:53:35.182
You apologized, right?

00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:39.119
We have to expand.

00:53:39.286 --> 00:53:40.687
Sure. Mark?

00:53:42.923 --> 00:53:44.391
Is he mad about something?

00:53:45.692 --> 00:53:47.628
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:49.496
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work.

00:53:49.663 --> 00:53:51.365
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity.

00:53:51.532 --> 00:53:54.202
You could start by getting a story in the
BU student newspaper. It's The Bridge.

00:53:54.368 --> 00:53:56.036
They hate stories about Harvard.

00:53:56.203 --> 00:53:58.138
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer major.

00:53:58.305 --> 00:54:00.641
Tell them Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programming.

00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:02.343
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

00:54:02.509 --> 00:54:03.844
I do. Here's the arrangement.

00:54:04.011 --> 00:54:05.913
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:07.548
Dustin is vice president
and head of programming...

00:54:07.714 --> 00:54:10.217
...and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

00:54:10.384 --> 00:54:11.518
Chris is director of publicity...

00:54:11.685 --> 00:54:14.154
...and his compensation will depend on
the amount of work he ends up doing.

00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:15.289
Any questions?

00:54:15.455 --> 00:54:18.892
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

00:54:19.092 --> 00:54:20.227
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:54:20.294 --> 00:54:21.662
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:54:22.262 --> 00:54:23.630
Is there anything we can do?

00:54:23.797 --> 00:54:24.831
No, that's it.

00:54:24.998 --> 00:54:27.267
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

00:54:27.968 --> 00:54:29.937
- What?
- Stanford.

00:54:30.103 --> 00:54:32.272
It's time for them to see this
in Palo Alto.

00:54:38.145 --> 00:54:39.446
You don't want any lunch?

00:54:39.513 --> 00:54:40.547
No.

00:54:41.081 --> 00:54:42.583
You're welcome to some salad.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.251
No, thank you.

00:54:50.657 --> 00:54:51.725
This must be hard.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:54.294
Who are you?

00:54:54.828 --> 00:54:57.131
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

00:54:57.297 --> 00:54:58.599
I mean, what do you do?

00:54:58.966 --> 00:55:01.001
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

00:55:01.168 --> 00:55:03.737
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

00:55:05.339 --> 00:55:06.473
What are you doing?

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.576
Checking in to see
how it's going in Bosnia.

00:55:09.743 --> 00:55:10.944
Bosnia.

00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:14.248
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:21.889
You must really hate
the Winklevosses.

00:55:22.723 --> 00:55:23.991
I don't hate anybody.

00:55:25.225 --> 00:55:28.462
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:31.064
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives...

00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:34.301
...things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

00:55:41.074 --> 00:55:42.743
He's expanding.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:44.077
- What?
- He's expanding...

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:46.903
...to Yale, Columbia and
Stanford. It's gonna be in The Crimson.

00:55:47.014 --> 00:55:48.048
- Really?
- Yep.

00:55:48.215 --> 00:55:51.351
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist
letter really scared the shit out of him.

00:55:51.518 --> 00:55:54.555
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down.

00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:57.624
Every minute the site is up, Harvard
Connection becomes less valuable.

00:55:57.791 --> 00:56:00.494
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:02.396
- And I want him dead.
- Yeah, I want those things too.

00:56:02.463 --> 00:56:04.164
Why aren't we doing anything about it?

00:56:04.331 --> 00:56:05.532
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

00:56:05.699 --> 00:56:07.334
You're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:08.035
How's it gonna look?

00:56:08.102 --> 00:56:09.736
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes...

00:56:09.803 --> 00:56:11.972
...chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.809
Cam, he's violated
Massachusetts state law.

00:56:15.976 --> 00:56:17.711
When he goes to
New York and California...

00:56:17.878 --> 00:56:19.146
...he'll have violated federal law.

00:56:19.313 --> 00:56:21.014
And he's in violation of Harvard law.

00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:23.016
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

00:56:23.183 --> 00:56:25.619
Wait. Yeah, there is.

00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:32.025
Harvard Student Handbook.

00:56:32.192 --> 00:56:34.928
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:36.964
You can't steal from another student.

00:56:38.398 --> 00:56:40.100
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

00:56:40.267 --> 00:56:42.436
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

00:56:42.603 --> 00:56:44.171
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

00:56:44.237 --> 00:56:47.174
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

00:56:47.441 --> 00:56:49.810
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

00:56:49.977 --> 00:56:53.380
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

00:56:53.547 --> 00:56:54.948
Why Stanford?

00:56:55.115 --> 00:56:56.884
Why do you think?

00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:02.523
I'm sorry.

00:57:02.723 --> 00:57:04.191
I'm late for biochem.

00:57:05.859 --> 00:57:06.894
Okay.

00:57:09.696 --> 00:57:10.964
You don't know my name, do you?

00:57:11.698 --> 00:57:12.799
Is it Stanford?

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.335
I should just kick your ass.

00:57:15.502 --> 00:57:17.604
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

00:57:17.871 --> 00:57:21.041
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:24.311
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

00:57:24.745 --> 00:57:25.979
What's my major?

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.081
- Trombone.
- Really?

00:57:28.682 --> 00:57:30.584
I remember something
about a trombone.

00:57:34.354 --> 00:57:36.790
French. Your major's French.

00:57:36.957 --> 00:57:38.525
- And yours?
- Mine?

00:57:38.692 --> 00:57:40.861
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

00:57:42.095 --> 00:57:43.297
I don't go to school.

00:57:43.463 --> 00:57:45.265
- You're kidding.
- No.

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:47.534
Well, where did you go to school?

00:57:47.701 --> 00:57:50.170
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.

00:57:50.337 --> 00:57:51.171
Seriously?

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:54.174
You're not like 15 years old
or anything, are you?

00:57:54.775 --> 00:57:55.943
No.

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.912
- Wait, you're not like 15, are you?
- No.

00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:02.115
So, what do you do?

00:58:03.283 --> 00:58:04.818
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:58:04.985 --> 00:58:07.421
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

00:58:07.588 --> 00:58:09.823
- What would you say?
- That I'm an entrepreneur.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.592
Well, then,
what was your latest preneur?

00:58:11.758 --> 00:58:14.128
Well, I founded an Internet company
that let folks...

00:58:14.294 --> 00:58:16.130
...download and share music for free.

00:58:16.296 --> 00:58:17.564
Kind of like Napster?

00:58:17.731 --> 00:58:19.266
Exactly like Napster.

00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:21.001
What do you mean?

00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:22.436
I founded Napster.

00:58:22.603 --> 00:58:24.405
Sean Parker founded Napster.

00:58:24.471 --> 00:58:25.706
Nice to meet you.

00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:27.875
You're Sean Parker?

00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:29.743
You see, the shoe's on the other...

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:31.979
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

00:58:33.247 --> 00:58:34.548
I just slept with Sean Parker?

00:58:34.715 --> 00:58:36.383
You just slept on Sean Parker.

00:58:36.984 --> 00:58:39.186
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

00:58:39.353 --> 00:58:40.821
What are you?

00:58:41.488 --> 00:58:43.423
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music...

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.527
...less when you're being sued by
everyone who's been to the Grammys.

00:58:46.693 --> 00:58:48.095
This is blowing my mind.

00:58:48.262 --> 00:58:49.029
I appreciate that.

00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:51.198
I gotta get ready for class.

00:58:51.265 --> 00:58:54.668
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

00:58:55.169 --> 00:58:56.403
You passed.

00:58:56.803 --> 00:58:57.838
I'm a hard worker.

00:58:59.406 --> 00:59:03.143
There's juice or anything else
you can find. Help yourself.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:04.711
You mind if I check my e-mail?

00:59:04.878 --> 00:59:06.513
Yeah, go ahead.

00:59:16.523 --> 00:59:17.691
Amy!

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:20.994
Jesus.

00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:23.430
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:25.832
Just a second.

00:59:28.802 --> 00:59:30.237
There's a snake in here, Amy.

00:59:30.404 --> 00:59:31.438
What?

00:59:33.874 --> 00:59:34.708
Where?

00:59:34.875 --> 00:59:36.210
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

00:59:36.577 --> 00:59:38.778
Are you kidding me?
I could've been killed.

00:59:38.845 --> 00:59:39.546
How?

00:59:39.613 --> 00:59:43.717
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

00:59:43.817 --> 00:59:44.919
What do you need to ask me?

00:59:45.085 --> 00:59:48.622
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:53.093
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

00:59:53.159 --> 00:59:54.828
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

00:59:54.995 --> 00:59:57.965
Stanford's had it for, like,
two weeks now.

00:59:58.165 --> 01:00:01.268
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:03.704
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:05.272
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:06.874
Yeah, is everything okay?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.809
Everything's great.

01:00:09.376 --> 01:00:13.814
I just need to find you,
Mark Zuckerberg.

01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:19.319
I've never been in this building before.

01:00:19.386 --> 01:00:23.657
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

01:00:25.092 --> 01:00:26.760
We're sitting in chairs.

01:00:27.594 --> 01:00:28.729
Yes.

01:00:29.596 --> 01:00:31.932
Very good. You can go in now.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:39.139
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:40.874
Well, darkness
is the absence of light...

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.710
...and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:45.712
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

01:00:45.879 --> 01:00:47.781
Students. Undergrads.

01:00:48.348 --> 01:00:49.183
I don't know.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.052
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.054
All right, bye-bye.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:55.356
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

01:00:55.522 --> 01:00:57.324
I'm Cameron Winklevoss.
This is my brother, Tyler.

01:00:57.391 --> 01:00:59.326
And you're here because...?

01:01:01.028 --> 01:01:02.095
Either of you can answer.

01:01:02.262 --> 01:01:04.831
- I thought you were reading the letter.
- I've read the letter.

01:01:04.998 --> 01:01:08.168
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection.

01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:09.970
We've since changed the name
to ConnectU.

01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:12.940
- Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea.
- I understand.

01:01:13.106 --> 01:01:15.309
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

01:01:15.476 --> 01:01:19.513
Sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman...

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.482
...under the heading "Standards of
Conduct in the Harvard Community"...

01:01:22.649 --> 01:01:25.686
...it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming...

01:01:25.853 --> 01:01:28.188
...in their dealings with members
in this community.

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:31.158
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership...

01:01:31.325 --> 01:01:33.260
...and instances of theft,
misappropriation or...

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:34.862
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:36.830
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

01:01:39.766 --> 01:01:43.537
- ...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action...

01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:45.839
...including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.941
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

01:01:48.108 --> 01:01:51.445
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

01:01:51.612 --> 01:01:54.615
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

01:01:54.682 --> 01:01:56.183
And you've spoken
to your House Master?

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.702
Yes, sir. The House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board...

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.120
...but the Ad Board won't see us.

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:02.189
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

01:02:02.256 --> 01:02:03.668
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been
responding to any of...

01:02:03.814 --> 01:02:06.038
...our e-mails or phone calls
for the last two weeks.

01:02:06.326 --> 01:02:08.061
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door...

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.063
...and the closest I've come
to dealing with him...

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.399
...is when I saw him
and chased him through Harvard Square.

01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:13.700
You chased him?

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:16.837
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:20.407
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

01:02:20.574 --> 01:02:22.877
There's a code of ethics and an
honor code and he violated them both.

01:02:23.043 --> 01:02:26.513
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

01:02:27.347 --> 01:02:30.717
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:31.852
I'm devastated by that.

01:02:31.919 --> 01:02:34.488
What my brother means is, if Mark
Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room...

01:02:34.655 --> 01:02:37.090
...and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:39.159
This office doesn't handle
petty larceny.

01:02:39.326 --> 01:02:40.594
This isn't petty larceny.

01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:42.829
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

01:02:42.996 --> 01:02:44.097
- Millions?
- Yes.

01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:46.767
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:49.670
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

01:02:49.837 --> 01:02:54.007
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

01:02:54.174 --> 01:02:55.442
Letting our imaginations run away
with us...

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:57.611
...is what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.514
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations...

01:03:00.681 --> 01:03:02.583
- ...run away with you on a new project.
- You would?

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:04.818
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

01:03:05.185 --> 01:03:09.489
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:13.293
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.463
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:18.398
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert...

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:20.200
...to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:21.902
And you're saying that I don't?

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:23.904
- Of course I'm not saying that.
- I'm saying that.

01:03:24.071 --> 01:03:25.739
- Really?
- Sir.

01:03:25.939 --> 01:03:27.808
Anne,
how did they get this appointment?

01:03:27.875 --> 01:03:29.743
Colleagues of their father.

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.647
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss...

01:03:33.814 --> 01:03:36.149
...since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:40.521
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here, is wrong.

01:03:40.787 --> 01:03:44.057
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:46.427
You don't get special treatment.

01:03:46.593 --> 01:03:48.962
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

01:03:49.329 --> 01:03:51.164
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:52.666
If you have a problem with that...

01:03:52.733 --> 01:03:54.101
We never asked for special treatment.

01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:57.971
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

01:03:58.038 --> 01:03:59.339
You can take the handbook
and shove it...

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:00.541
Ty.

01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:03.410
Thank you very much for your time,
sir.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.653
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

01:04:14.288 --> 01:04:17.357
Eduardo, spring break, you and
Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

01:04:17.424 --> 01:04:19.927
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:24.030
Well, as CFO, I had set up some
meetings with potential advertisers.

01:04:24.565 --> 01:04:25.632
Who paid for the trip?

01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:28.802
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

01:04:28.969 --> 01:04:31.471
At this point,
your $1,000 was the only money...

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:32.806
...that had been put into the company?

01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:34.842
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:38.412
- They went terribly.
- Why?

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:39.513
Mark was asleep.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.215
I was not asleep.

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:42.516
Can I rephrase my answer?

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:44.718
I wish he'd been asleep.

01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:51.024
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:52.926
People who go on The Facebook...

01:04:53.093 --> 01:04:55.429
...tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

01:04:55.596 --> 01:04:57.264
Now, here's the most
impressive statistic.

01:04:57.431 --> 01:05:00.367
Ninety-one percent of people
who try it once will come back.

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:02.469
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

01:05:02.636 --> 01:05:04.805
What sound is he making?
Is that like a tsk?

01:05:07.808 --> 01:05:09.476
It wasn't a tsk.

01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:11.011
It was...

01:05:11.912 --> 01:05:13.747
Like a glottal stop.

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:16.083
Almost a gag reflex.

01:05:17.684 --> 01:05:19.386
Guys, what is this?

01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:22.122
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:23.557
Yes, it was a dinner.

01:05:23.724 --> 01:05:25.092
It was set up through
my girlfriend at that time.

01:05:25.259 --> 01:05:28.228
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

01:05:28.395 --> 01:05:30.564
Yes. Very.

01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:32.633
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:34.568
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

01:05:34.735 --> 01:05:37.471
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

01:05:37.638 --> 01:05:39.473
- Mark.
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.475
Unless you're the ballet theater
of Hartford...

01:05:41.642 --> 01:05:43.577
...the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

01:05:43.744 --> 01:05:44.811
It isn't a business yet.

01:05:44.978 --> 01:05:48.682
That's tough for me, because my jo...
Never mind.

01:05:51.585 --> 01:05:52.920
He's 25 minutes late.

01:05:53.086 --> 01:05:55.756
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

01:05:55.923 --> 01:05:57.491
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

01:05:57.658 --> 01:05:59.092
He's 25 minutes late.

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.460
I think Wardo's jealous.

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:03.764
I honestly wasn't jealous.
I was nervous.

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:04.998
Why?

01:06:05.165 --> 01:06:08.502
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

01:06:08.669 --> 01:06:11.939
And he struck me as kind of a...

01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.275
A wild card.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:16.510
Why?

01:06:16.677 --> 01:06:19.813
He crashed out of two pretty big Internet
companies in spectacular fashion...

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.683
- ...he's had a reputation with drugs.
- He also founded the companies.

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:24.151
We don't need him.

01:06:25.385 --> 01:06:26.219
He's here.

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.524
No, no, take your time.

01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:33.427
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:36.530
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

01:06:36.697 --> 01:06:39.466
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

01:06:39.633 --> 01:06:41.535
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

01:06:41.702 --> 01:06:43.103
You guys don't have anything.

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:44.304
- No.
- Tori.

01:06:44.471 --> 01:06:45.972
- We were waiting.
- Hey, baby boy.

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:47.741
Can you bring out some things?

01:06:47.808 --> 01:06:50.644
The lacquered pork with
that ginger confit. Tuna tartar?

01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:52.579
And the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.

01:06:52.746 --> 01:06:54.515
Christy, what do you like to drink?

01:06:56.149 --> 01:06:57.317
An appletini.

01:06:57.484 --> 01:06:59.486
Great. Four of those.

01:07:00.187 --> 01:07:02.856
From that point on,
it was a Seanathon.

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:14.368
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

01:07:25.846 --> 01:07:28.081
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:31.185
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:34.354
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

01:07:34.521 --> 01:07:37.658
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties...

01:07:37.725 --> 01:07:40.394
...but I guess to them
that was a little like...

01:07:40.761 --> 01:07:42.829
...selling a stolen car
to pay for the stolen gas.

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:45.432
So we said screw it,
declared bankruptcy.

01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:48.202
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

01:07:48.368 --> 01:07:50.037
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:52.372
And then he went on to
his second business venture...

01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:56.076
...which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:58.145
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

01:07:58.579 --> 01:08:02.082
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes, but
nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:05.252
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

01:08:05.452 --> 01:08:08.388
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

01:08:08.555 --> 01:08:10.724
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

01:08:10.891 --> 01:08:13.727
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

01:08:13.927 --> 01:08:16.330
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:18.665
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:20.901
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

01:08:21.068 --> 01:08:23.570
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

01:08:23.737 --> 01:08:26.240
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:29.209
And if somehow, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama...

01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:30.410
...they'll make shit up.

01:08:30.577 --> 01:08:33.113
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:36.416
And they want you to say
"thank you" while you, excuse me,

01:08:36.583 --> 01:08:37.984
...wipe your chin and walk away.

01:08:38.251 --> 01:08:39.186
That's what happened to you?

01:08:39.253 --> 01:08:40.787
And delusional.

01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:44.524
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:46.259
I brought down
the record companies with Napster...

01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:47.794
...and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

01:08:47.961 --> 01:08:50.297
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

01:08:50.897 --> 01:08:51.732
They won.

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:53.467
- In court.
- Yeah.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.370
You wanna buy a Tower Records,
Eduardo?

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:02.176
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley...

01:09:02.342 --> 01:09:06.280
...and parties at Stanford and down in L.A.,
and friends who'd become millionaires.

01:09:06.446 --> 01:09:11.318
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:14.521
And then he got around
to The Facebook.

01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:16.924
So tell me about your progress.

01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:20.827
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members...

01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:22.829
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:24.798
For instance,
we wanted Baylor, in Texas...

01:09:24.865 --> 01:09:26.833
...but Baylor already had
a social network on compus.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.435
So instead of going right after them...

01:09:28.502 --> 01:09:30.370
...we made a list of every school
within 100 miles.

01:09:30.437 --> 01:09:31.839
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:34.341
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were
seeing their friends on our site.

01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:35.843
It's called the Little Bighorn. Smart.

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:37.477
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

01:09:37.644 --> 01:09:39.313
You know what?
Settle an argument for us.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.515
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook.

01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:43.317
Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:44.685
Well.

01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:46.553
Neither of you yet.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.089
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:49.950
Yeah.

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:51.892
You don't wanna ruin it with ads.
Ads aren't cool.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:52.793
Exactly.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.401
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus...

01:09:54.428 --> 01:09:56.196
...and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11.

01:09:56.263 --> 01:09:57.297
That's exactly right.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.196
You don't even know...

01:09:58.242 --> 01:09:59.580
- ...what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:03.303
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.372
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

01:10:05.539 --> 01:10:06.740
You?

01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:10.511
"A billion dollars."

01:10:14.114 --> 01:10:15.682
And that shut everybody up.

01:10:15.849 --> 01:10:18.886
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.386
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with...

01:10:22.423 --> 01:10:24.324
...a chain of very successful
yogurt shops.

01:10:24.758 --> 01:10:28.395
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:31.865
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:33.700
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

01:10:33.867 --> 01:10:35.035
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:37.737
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

01:10:37.804 --> 01:10:38.704
Have you seen the big ones up close?

01:10:38.772 --> 01:10:40.006
No I haven't,
but I don't think the guy's...

01:10:40.052 --> 01:10:41.508
...holding a marlin the
size of a Range Rover.

01:10:41.675 --> 01:10:44.044
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

01:10:44.211 --> 01:10:45.846
Think we might be getting away
from the point?

01:10:46.013 --> 01:10:50.217
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

01:10:50.517 --> 01:10:52.286
He owned Mark after that dinner.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.556
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon...

01:10:55.722 --> 01:10:56.990
...and he was gone.

01:10:57.157 --> 01:11:00.727
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:05.566
Drop the "The."
Just "Facebook."

01:11:06.133 --> 01:11:07.668
It's cleaner.

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:11.638
Shit.

01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:15.409
Goodbye, sweetie.

01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:17.644
Yeah.

01:11:21.515 --> 01:11:24.418
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

01:11:24.585 --> 01:11:26.720
You wanna end the party at 11.

01:11:27.654 --> 01:11:30.924
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:33.160
So, what do you think?

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:35.229
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

01:11:35.395 --> 01:11:38.432
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:39.800
Doesn't that sound good?

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:41.635
If you're a trout.

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:43.203
I'm going to enter this into the record.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:47.041
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

01:11:47.407 --> 01:11:49.409
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

01:11:49.576 --> 01:11:52.212
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation...

01:11:52.279 --> 01:11:55.683
...state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg...

01:11:56.049 --> 01:11:59.119
...30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

01:11:59.286 --> 01:12:00.320
Yeah, we stipulate.

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:03.223
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:04.658
You have anything here?

01:12:04.725 --> 01:12:05.926
Yes. Thank you.

01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:09.129
Mr. Saverin,
have you ever done anything...

01:12:09.296 --> 01:12:11.832
...that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

01:12:13.634 --> 01:12:14.668
No.

01:12:14.835 --> 01:12:19.339
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

01:12:19.973 --> 01:12:21.341
- No.
- No?

01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:25.913
No.

01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:28.215
You were accused of animal cruelty.

01:12:29.816 --> 01:12:32.219
- Wait.
- You weren't?

01:12:32.386 --> 01:12:34.355
This is not happening.

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:36.757
I have here an article
from The Crimson...

01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:38.358
Jesus Christ.

01:12:38.425 --> 01:12:39.493
I can't have this, Wardo.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.863
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

01:12:44.398 --> 01:12:46.633
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.136
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to...

01:12:49.303 --> 01:12:53.207
...for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

01:12:53.574 --> 01:12:56.143
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:57.477
"Junior Eduardo Saverin."

01:12:57.611 --> 01:12:59.580
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals...

01:12:59.747 --> 01:13:00.981
...is probably bad for business.

01:13:01.148 --> 01:13:05.953
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

01:13:06.119 --> 01:13:09.890
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.792
- This is scathing.
- Nine hundred fifty- six.

01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:14.728
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark...

01:13:15.095 --> 01:13:16.463
...and I had the chicken with me...

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:18.765
...because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

01:13:18.932 --> 01:13:19.866
This was college.

01:13:19.933 --> 01:13:21.582
Somebody's gonna have to answer
for this.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.635
Nine hundred sixty-nine.

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:24.538
The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner...

01:13:24.705 --> 01:13:27.040
...and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

01:13:27.207 --> 01:13:30.377
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

01:13:30.944 --> 01:13:32.579
The next thing I knew...

01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:35.249
...I was being accused
of forced cannibalism.

01:13:35.449 --> 01:13:37.751
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

01:13:37.885 --> 01:13:40.054
I dealt with the various
animal rights groups...

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:42.489
...I dealt with the
associate dean of the college.

01:13:42.956 --> 01:13:44.458
This was all resolved.

01:13:44.691 --> 01:13:45.726
Nine hundred eighty-eight.

01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.061
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

01:13:48.228 --> 01:13:49.763
For all I know,
it was the Winklevosses.

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:51.265
All right, let's just forget about it.

01:13:51.432 --> 01:13:54.568
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

01:13:54.635 --> 01:13:56.136
It's better to be accused
of necrophilia.

01:13:56.303 --> 01:13:57.971
It is better to be accused
of necrophilia.

01:13:58.138 --> 01:14:01.308
I have to explain this to my father. I'm
gonna have to explain this to everybody.

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:02.909
What is happening on that?

01:14:02.976 --> 01:14:04.978
I have my final coming up
for Contemporary Art...

01:14:05.145 --> 01:14:06.346
...and I haven't been to class.

01:14:06.513 --> 01:14:07.681
I'm supposed to write
about these paintings.

01:14:08.081 --> 01:14:10.484
- That's a Facebook page?
- Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:11.985
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

01:14:12.152 --> 01:14:15.155
Every once in a while, I hop on and
stir the pot to get a good debate going.

01:14:15.322 --> 01:14:17.591
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

01:14:17.758 --> 01:14:20.360
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.070
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:26.600
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:32.706
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:34.508
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

01:14:34.675 --> 01:14:37.344
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:40.180
In fact, when we raised the subject
with him, he defended you.

01:14:43.517 --> 01:14:46.153
Nine ninety-three. We are so close.

01:14:46.787 --> 01:14:49.923
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:52.025
Yeah, no, I agree.
More servers, more help.

01:14:52.192 --> 01:14:53.861
I'm interviewing interns
to come to Palo Alto.

01:14:54.027 --> 01:14:55.195
We're gonna have to pay them.

01:14:55.362 --> 01:14:56.897
- What?
- I already found a house for rent...

01:14:56.964 --> 01:14:58.632
...on a street two blocks from Stanford.

01:14:59.099 --> 01:15:00.300
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

01:15:00.467 --> 01:15:02.402
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:03.537
When did I actually decide?

01:15:03.604 --> 01:15:06.740
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

01:15:07.474 --> 01:15:09.643
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:10.911
What, you're Jed Clampett?

01:15:11.078 --> 01:15:13.247
I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.

01:15:13.413 --> 01:15:15.015
Yeah, got the show in Brazil,
it was genius.

01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:18.318
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

01:15:18.585 --> 01:15:20.587
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:24.224
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

01:15:24.391 --> 01:15:26.360
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

01:15:26.527 --> 01:15:28.896
As somebody who's embarrassed
the company in a bad way...

01:15:29.062 --> 01:15:31.198
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:32.766
Hit "refresh."

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.570
One hundred fifty thousand and four.

01:15:36.737 --> 01:15:39.072
A hundred and fifty thousand members,
Wardo.

01:15:39.473 --> 01:15:41.141
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

01:15:41.308 --> 01:15:45.312
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

01:15:45.479 --> 01:15:46.747
Who came up with nothing.

01:15:46.814 --> 01:15:49.149
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

01:15:49.216 --> 01:15:51.118
- We don't know that's true.
- You can read about it.

01:15:51.185 --> 01:15:52.820
I can read about you torturing birds...

01:15:53.086 --> 01:15:56.723
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

01:15:59.193 --> 01:16:00.027
What's he talking about?

01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:02.730
I'm interviewing interns at 10
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

01:16:03.096 --> 01:16:04.231
Get on board with this, man.

01:16:04.398 --> 01:16:06.900
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:32.626
You can do one more! One more!

01:16:37.497 --> 01:16:38.365
Wardo!

01:16:38.532 --> 01:16:39.766
Yo! Mark!

01:16:41.602 --> 01:16:42.636
What's going on?

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:45.138
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server...

01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:46.540
...expose its SSL encryption...

01:16:46.707 --> 01:16:48.442
...and then intercept all traffic.

01:16:48.608 --> 01:16:49.476
They're hacking.

01:16:49.643 --> 01:16:51.578
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
Here's the beauty.

01:16:51.645 --> 01:16:53.380
You know I didn't understand
anything you said.

01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:54.715
- I do.
- So, what's the beauty?

01:16:54.882 --> 01:16:56.650
Every tenth line of code written,
drink a shot.

01:16:56.817 --> 01:16:59.753
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every
time the server detects an intrusion...

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.822
...the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

01:17:01.989 --> 01:17:03.457
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window...

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.292
...appear simultaneously
on all five computers.

01:17:05.459 --> 01:17:07.461
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

01:17:07.628 --> 01:17:09.663
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.199
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

01:17:12.366 --> 01:17:15.936
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's
job will they need to be able to do drunk?

01:17:16.103 --> 01:17:17.137
You're right.

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:20.474
A more relevant test might be seeing if
they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:24.178
- That was mean.
- Here.

01:17:24.544 --> 01:17:25.379
What is this?

01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:28.549
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

01:17:30.017 --> 01:17:31.852
Will that get you through the summer?

01:17:32.019 --> 01:17:33.153
- Here!
- Mark?

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.521
Right here!

01:17:39.693 --> 01:17:41.528
Welcome to Facebook.

01:17:50.904 --> 01:17:52.573
- Eighteen thousand dollars?
- Yes.

01:17:52.739 --> 01:17:55.008
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

01:17:55.175 --> 01:17:57.678
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

01:17:57.845 --> 01:17:59.046
- Yes.
- Hang on.

01:18:01.215 --> 01:18:02.649
I'm just checking your math on that.

01:18:02.816 --> 01:18:05.085
Yes, I got the same thing.

01:18:05.686 --> 01:18:06.753
May I continue?

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:10.224
After expressing misgivings about
Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company...

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:12.359
...and moving it to California
for the summer...

01:18:12.526 --> 01:18:15.462
...why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:19.299
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

01:18:19.466 --> 01:18:22.269
I figured Mark, Dustin and the
new interns could work on the site...

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:25.005
...while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

01:18:25.172 --> 01:18:29.676
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

01:18:31.478 --> 01:18:33.247
Go, go, go.

01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:39.419
- I didn't die.
- I know.

01:18:39.586 --> 01:18:41.388
- I made it.
- You did.

01:18:42.823 --> 01:18:44.091
Okay, ready?

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:46.426
- That was like an eight.
- That was like a two.

01:18:46.593 --> 01:18:48.929
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

01:18:57.571 --> 01:18:58.405
I'm okay.

01:18:58.472 --> 01:18:59.707
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:19:03.076 --> 01:19:04.411
That's the doorbell.

01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:05.846
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:08.415
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

01:19:08.682 --> 01:19:10.617
That's gonna cut
into your security deposit.

01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:13.754
- Andrew.
- Not now.

01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:15.222
Good boy.

01:19:19.326 --> 01:19:20.627
- Sean?
- Mark?

01:19:20.794 --> 01:19:22.729
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

01:19:23.163 --> 01:19:24.522
- Do you?
- We were across the street.

01:19:24.568 --> 01:19:25.344
We saw the chimney.

01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:28.035
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:30.904
I'm Sharon.

01:19:31.071 --> 01:19:33.307
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

01:19:33.473 --> 01:19:34.875
I was helping her move.
We saw the chimney...

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:36.510
We had a zip line to the pool.

01:19:37.678 --> 01:19:40.147
You came to California.

01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:41.615
Yeah.

01:19:41.782 --> 01:19:43.851
You made the right choice.

01:19:49.857 --> 01:19:51.325
Here you go.

01:19:55.495 --> 01:19:56.530
Sharon?

01:19:58.766 --> 01:19:59.833
I'm so sorry.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:00.818
- No problem.
- I didn't know...

01:20:00.835 --> 01:20:02.436
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

01:20:04.538 --> 01:20:08.609
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

01:20:09.376 --> 01:20:10.677
I'm Sean Parker.

01:20:10.844 --> 01:20:11.945
Oh, he's wired in.

01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:14.147
That's what I'm talking about.

01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:16.817
Where's Eduardo?

01:20:17.017 --> 01:20:19.486
He got an internship in New York.

01:20:20.153 --> 01:20:21.522
Eduardo didn't come out?

01:20:42.042 --> 01:20:44.811
I was crashing there for a bit
while I'm taking care of some things...

01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:48.348
...but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

01:20:48.515 --> 01:20:51.885
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

01:20:52.052 --> 01:20:54.488
What's your plan for the summer?

01:20:55.656 --> 01:20:56.857
Mark?

01:20:57.491 --> 01:20:59.660
I'm sorry.
I was looking at the architecture.

01:21:00.994 --> 01:21:02.296
I asked what your plan for the...

01:21:02.362 --> 01:21:03.564
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

01:21:03.731 --> 01:21:05.299
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

01:21:05.866 --> 01:21:07.868
Yeah, I'll go with you.

01:21:11.405 --> 01:21:13.033
Your date looks so familiar to me.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.541
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

01:21:14.808 --> 01:21:16.009
What do you mean?

01:21:18.011 --> 01:21:21.348
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie...

01:21:21.515 --> 01:21:24.251
...but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

01:21:24.418 --> 01:21:26.253
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place...

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.589
...that doesn't make you feel
like a pervert.

01:21:28.755 --> 01:21:32.693
He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows
another 40,000 from his in-laws...

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.762
...opens a store
and calls it Victoria's Secret.

01:21:35.929 --> 01:21:38.565
Makes a half million dollars
his first year.

01:21:38.732 --> 01:21:42.469
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, sells the company...

01:21:42.636 --> 01:21:45.873
...to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

01:21:46.039 --> 01:21:47.207
Happy ending, right?

01:21:47.741 --> 01:21:51.945
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million...

01:21:52.112 --> 01:21:55.382
...and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

01:21:57.584 --> 01:22:01.388
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

01:22:02.556 --> 01:22:03.957
Was that a parable?

01:22:04.758 --> 01:22:08.929
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:10.564
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

01:22:10.731 --> 01:22:11.798
I read your blog.

01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:14.034
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

01:22:14.201 --> 01:22:15.836
You know why I started Napster?

01:22:16.904 --> 01:22:18.572
The girl I loved in high school...

01:22:18.739 --> 01:22:21.642
...was with the co-captain
of the varsity lacrosse team...

01:22:21.808 --> 01:22:23.777
...and I wanted to take her from him.

01:22:23.944 --> 01:22:25.812
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

01:22:26.246 --> 01:22:28.749
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:32.252
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

01:22:32.419 --> 01:22:36.590
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

01:22:36.757 --> 01:22:39.126
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

01:22:39.293 --> 01:22:41.895
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

01:22:42.062 --> 01:22:43.764
What the VCs want is to say,

01:22:43.931 --> 01:22:46.667
"Good idea, kid,
the grown- ups will take it from here."

01:22:46.834 --> 01:22:49.436
But not this time. This is our time.

01:22:49.903 --> 01:22:53.307
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:55.242
"I'm CEO, bitch."

01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:57.945
That's what I want for you.

01:22:58.946 --> 01:23:00.581
So where the hell is Eduardo?

01:23:01.748 --> 01:23:04.151
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

01:23:04.318 --> 01:23:06.253
- He's got an...
- An internship.

01:23:07.521 --> 01:23:11.024
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

01:23:12.026 --> 01:23:13.761
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

01:23:14.027 --> 01:23:15.095
I know you do.

01:23:15.262 --> 01:23:18.098
Wardo wants to be a businessman and
for all I know he's gonna be a good one...

01:23:18.265 --> 01:23:21.268
...but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:25.940
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

01:23:26.573 --> 01:23:30.344
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

01:23:31.979 --> 01:23:36.083
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:23:37.818 --> 01:23:40.420
- Do you ever think about that girl?
- What girl?

01:23:40.587 --> 01:23:43.924
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

01:23:45.192 --> 01:23:46.226
No.

01:23:46.393 --> 01:23:49.763
If you guys are gonna talk
about bandwidth, we need shots.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.431
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

01:23:51.598 --> 01:23:54.034
- Yeah.
- Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

01:23:54.201 --> 01:23:58.605
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:00.874
Two continen...

01:24:05.279 --> 01:24:06.747
If you don't have a place to crash...

01:24:06.914 --> 01:24:09.183
...I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

01:24:10.117 --> 01:24:12.019
Let's line up some shots.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:14.221
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:17.424
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

01:24:17.591 --> 01:24:19.459
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

01:24:35.676 --> 01:24:38.679
Attention. Go!

01:24:55.329 --> 01:24:59.833
At the barrier, Hollandia is leading
Harvard University by one length.

01:25:09.677 --> 01:25:11.044
Approaching the grandstands...

01:25:11.211 --> 01:25:14.248
...Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.

01:25:27.461 --> 01:25:28.695
Come on!

01:26:07.367 --> 01:26:08.702
Whatever.

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:15.375
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

01:26:15.542 --> 01:26:17.344
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:19.680
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

01:26:19.847 --> 01:26:20.881
Sir?

01:26:21.048 --> 01:26:22.583
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

01:26:22.749 --> 01:26:24.751
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

01:26:24.918 --> 01:26:27.988
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

01:26:28.055 --> 01:26:28.855
Yes, Your Highness.

01:26:28.889 --> 01:26:31.959
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

01:26:32.326 --> 01:26:35.929
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

01:26:36.063 --> 01:26:37.698
Have you?
Have you seen a race that close?

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:38.899
No, Your Highness.

01:26:38.966 --> 01:26:41.335
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

01:26:41.502 --> 01:26:44.438
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

01:26:44.471 --> 01:26:45.672
May I introduce my teammates?

01:26:45.739 --> 01:26:47.408
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

01:26:47.674 --> 01:26:49.309
On to the Dutch.

01:26:52.713 --> 01:26:54.247
Sorry you flew out here to see that.

01:26:54.314 --> 01:26:56.383
Wouldn't have missed it.
How was the royalty?

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:59.086
I just wanted him to tell me a couple
more times how close the race was.

01:26:59.153 --> 01:27:02.823
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:04.491
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

01:27:04.658 --> 01:27:05.692
Relax, it's fine.

01:27:05.859 --> 01:27:06.894
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:09.029
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:10.698
Sorry you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

01:27:10.765 --> 01:27:13.100
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:15.903
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:18.105
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

01:27:18.772 --> 01:27:21.408
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

01:27:21.575 --> 01:27:23.243
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:24.945
I've just had a chat with my daughter.

01:27:25.212 --> 01:27:27.881
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race...

01:27:28.048 --> 01:27:30.284
...which they've just seen
via their computers.

01:27:30.317 --> 01:27:34.154
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:37.658
I'm gonna find your mother.

01:27:39.492 --> 01:27:40.327
Have I said something wrong?

01:27:40.394 --> 01:27:42.296
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

01:27:42.362 --> 01:27:43.464
No, no. Cambridge.

01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:46.333
Majoring in French literature.
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.735
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

01:27:47.801 --> 01:27:50.037
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

01:27:50.204 --> 01:27:52.873
- That's where her friends are.
- That's awesome.

01:27:53.507 --> 01:27:57.010
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

01:27:59.346 --> 01:28:00.747
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

01:28:04.484 --> 01:28:06.420
If this is online, I wanna see it.

01:28:06.486 --> 01:28:07.821
Stop it.

01:28:08.355 --> 01:28:09.857
Stop it, Cam.

01:28:10.257 --> 01:28:11.758
Knock it off.

01:28:12.326 --> 01:28:14.962
I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch
today by less than a second.

01:28:15.128 --> 01:28:17.130
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:18.665
And they'll see us again.

01:28:18.832 --> 01:28:20.934
What I mind,
and what you should mind...

01:28:21.101 --> 01:28:24.204
...is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:26.807
We tried talking to him,
we tried writing a letter...

01:28:26.874 --> 01:28:30.210
...we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

01:28:30.477 --> 01:28:32.913
Now, I am asking you
for the last time...

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:38.252
...let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in federal court.

01:28:38.685 --> 01:28:39.953
Come on.

01:28:41.355 --> 01:28:43.190
I need a real drink.

01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:51.298
Screw it.

01:28:52.533 --> 01:28:54.768
Let's gut the frigging nerd.

01:28:57.604 --> 01:28:58.939
That's what I'm talking about!

01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:00.941
No, no, no.

01:29:01.058 --> 01:29:03.260
But check it out, I saw him today.

01:29:03.477 --> 01:29:05.912
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

01:29:05.979 --> 01:29:07.014
Hang on.

01:29:07.181 --> 01:29:08.882
Are you guys using spikes
or ghost missiles?

01:29:09.049 --> 01:29:10.484
We're just shooting at each other.

01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:12.085
Use sweet kamikazes.

01:29:12.252 --> 01:29:14.321
Like we know what that is.

01:29:14.621 --> 01:29:18.392
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me too.

01:29:18.659 --> 01:29:20.194
I know he did.

01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:25.566
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

01:29:25.732 --> 01:29:27.067
Bong hit.

01:29:27.701 --> 01:29:29.136
Does anybody hear that banging?

01:29:29.403 --> 01:29:31.738
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

01:29:31.905 --> 01:29:33.841
Dude, somebody's at the door.

01:29:34.007 --> 01:29:38.545
It's not a dish best served cold. It's best
served immediately and relentlessly.

01:29:42.249 --> 01:29:44.084
I'm gonna call you back.

01:29:45.953 --> 01:29:47.087
What's up?

01:29:47.154 --> 01:29:48.489
What's up?

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:52.125
Mark was supposed to pick me up
an hour ago.

01:29:52.192 --> 01:29:53.694
I've been calling his cell.

01:29:53.861 --> 01:29:58.298
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

01:30:04.571 --> 01:30:05.606
What happened here?

01:30:05.772 --> 01:30:09.209
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

01:30:09.376 --> 01:30:11.545
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:13.614
- Back to work.
- Okay.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.517
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

01:30:16.783 --> 01:30:18.585
I mean the more wasted that I get...

01:30:18.852 --> 01:30:20.087
We understand.

01:30:22.556 --> 01:30:23.590
How old are they, Sean?

01:30:24.157 --> 01:30:25.259
It's not polite to ask.

01:30:25.326 --> 01:30:26.460
Sean, how old are they?

01:30:27.995 --> 01:30:29.296
You think you know me, right?

01:30:29.463 --> 01:30:30.631
I've read enough.

01:30:30.797 --> 01:30:33.133
You know how much I've read
about you?

01:30:33.667 --> 01:30:35.002
Nothing.

01:30:38.872 --> 01:30:40.574
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

01:30:40.741 --> 01:30:43.577
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

01:30:43.744 --> 01:30:46.980
It's midnight. Or 3 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

01:30:47.347 --> 01:30:50.751
You gotta see some of the new stuff
we got. Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

01:30:50.918 --> 01:30:51.885
I'm just calling it the Wall.

01:30:52.052 --> 01:30:54.388
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

01:30:54.755 --> 01:30:56.256
You know Peter Thiel?

01:30:56.423 --> 01:30:57.658
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

01:30:57.824 --> 01:31:01.061
He just runs a 2-billion-dollar hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

01:31:02.563 --> 01:31:03.764
Why's he setting up meetings?

01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:05.065
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

01:31:05.132 --> 01:31:08.335
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

01:31:08.602 --> 01:31:11.171
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac...

01:31:11.338 --> 01:31:13.941
...then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone...

01:31:14.107 --> 01:31:17.411
...and in between there was a long flight.
I'm the business end of this company.

01:31:18.145 --> 01:31:20.514
And he is a houseguest
living here rent free...

01:31:20.681 --> 01:31:23.617
...on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

01:31:23.684 --> 01:31:26.854
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:28.589
- Hey, man.
- Harvard Bartending Course.

01:31:28.756 --> 01:31:31.925
You're just a small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.304
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

01:31:47.841 --> 01:31:49.142
Bong hit.

01:31:49.309 --> 01:31:51.545
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

01:31:52.379 --> 01:31:53.647
So how's it going?

01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:56.850
How's the internship? How's Christy?

01:31:57.851 --> 01:32:00.187
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

01:32:01.822 --> 01:32:03.724
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

01:32:03.891 --> 01:32:06.460
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

01:32:07.995 --> 01:32:10.364
I do remember you saying that.

01:32:10.431 --> 01:32:12.232
So how is Christy?

01:32:12.699 --> 01:32:14.368
Christy's crazy.

01:32:14.568 --> 01:32:16.236
- Is that fun?
- No.

01:32:16.503 --> 01:32:17.638
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

01:32:17.805 --> 01:32:22.709
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

01:32:23.377 --> 01:32:25.579
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

01:32:28.215 --> 01:32:32.219
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

01:32:32.386 --> 01:32:34.621
You gotta move out here.
This is where it's happening.

01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:36.423
- Did you hear what I said?
- The connections...

01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:37.691
Mark, you got...

01:32:37.758 --> 01:32:40.427
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

01:32:40.694 --> 01:32:42.863
I want... I need you out here.

01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:44.765
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you say?

01:32:44.932 --> 01:32:46.934
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined.

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:48.769
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

01:32:48.936 --> 01:32:50.737
- Sean thinks that...
- Sean is not part of this company.

01:32:50.804 --> 01:32:51.839
We have over 300,000 members.

01:32:52.105 --> 01:32:54.208
We're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

01:32:54.374 --> 01:32:57.277
- I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!
- We need more servers.

01:32:57.444 --> 01:32:58.946
We need more programmers
and more money...

01:32:59.112 --> 01:33:01.548
...and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over.

01:33:01.715 --> 01:33:02.883
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:04.718
- Without me knowing.
- You're in New York.

01:33:04.885 --> 01:33:08.722
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

01:33:08.889 --> 01:33:10.557
And how's it going so far?

01:33:15.028 --> 01:33:17.598
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

01:33:22.236 --> 01:33:23.570
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

01:33:23.737 --> 01:33:25.272
I'd like to freeze this bank account...

01:33:25.439 --> 01:33:28.742
...and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

01:33:30.077 --> 01:33:33.247
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

01:33:40.053 --> 01:33:41.255
Sean, he'll be right with you.

01:33:41.421 --> 01:33:42.789
No problem.

01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:46.827
You know this is where they filmed
Towering Inferno?

01:33:46.994 --> 01:33:48.695
That's comforting.

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:51.865
Hey, guys. Come on back.

01:33:53.367 --> 01:33:55.636
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

01:33:56.904 --> 01:33:58.238
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

01:33:58.605 --> 01:34:00.474
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

01:34:02.276 --> 01:34:05.546
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

01:34:05.712 --> 01:34:09.216
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:13.287
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

01:34:13.453 --> 01:34:15.455
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware...

01:34:15.622 --> 01:34:18.458
...and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

01:34:18.625 --> 01:34:20.894
Now, let me ask you something.

01:34:21.061 --> 01:34:22.996
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:44.585
Jesus Christ.

01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:50.724
- When did you get back?
- You scared me. I need you to knock.

01:34:50.891 --> 01:34:52.793
When did you get back?

01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:55.295
I got back this afternoon.

01:34:55.462 --> 01:34:56.864
And when were you gonna call me?

01:34:57.231 --> 01:34:59.833
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.837
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

01:35:04.004 --> 01:35:07.808
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

01:35:07.975 --> 01:35:09.476
Are you mocking me?

01:35:09.676 --> 01:35:10.878
I brought you a present.

01:35:12.713 --> 01:35:15.349
Why does your status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

01:35:15.516 --> 01:35:16.683
What?

01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:20.687
Why does your relationship status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

01:35:20.854 --> 01:35:22.489
Well, I was single
when I set up the page.

01:35:22.656 --> 01:35:24.591
And you just never bothered
to change it?

01:35:24.758 --> 01:35:25.826
What?

01:35:26.026 --> 01:35:27.427
I don't know how.

01:35:27.594 --> 01:35:29.363
Do I look stupid to you?

01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:30.564
No, calm down.

01:35:30.631 --> 01:35:33.000
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook...

01:35:33.267 --> 01:35:35.635
...doesn't know how to change
his relationship status?

01:35:35.702 --> 01:35:38.872
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you.

01:35:38.939 --> 01:35:40.307
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

01:35:40.374 --> 01:35:43.277
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts...

01:35:43.443 --> 01:35:44.611
...every time you go to see Mark.

01:35:44.678 --> 01:35:47.781
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts...

01:35:47.848 --> 01:35:50.517
...don't care what anyone's
relationship status is on Facebook.

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:52.219
Please, open your present.

01:35:52.386 --> 01:35:54.254
Your phone does work.

01:35:55.222 --> 01:35:56.290
It's Mark.

01:35:56.456 --> 01:35:58.159
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

01:35:58.225 --> 01:36:00.628
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

01:36:01.295 --> 01:36:02.930
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

01:36:03.330 --> 01:36:05.098
This'll be your first.

01:36:05.265 --> 01:36:06.300
Yeah.

01:36:06.466 --> 01:36:07.634
- You froze our account?
- I did.

01:36:07.801 --> 01:36:09.970
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention.

01:36:10.137 --> 01:36:11.805
Do you realize you jeopardized
the company?

01:36:11.972 --> 01:36:13.440
Your actions could have destroyed...

01:36:13.607 --> 01:36:15.342
- ...everything I've been working on.
- We've been working on.

01:36:15.509 --> 01:36:17.444
Without money, the site can't function.

01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:19.680
Let me tell you the difference between
Facebook and everybody.

01:36:19.847 --> 01:36:20.714
We don't crash ever!

01:36:20.881 --> 01:36:22.456
If the servers are
down for even a day,

01:36:22.502 --> 01:36:24.485
our entire reputation
is irreversibly destroyed.

01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:26.587
- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster proved that.

01:36:26.854 --> 01:36:29.489
Even a few people leaving would
reverberate through the user base.

01:36:29.656 --> 01:36:31.925
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

01:36:31.992 --> 01:36:33.727
College kids are online
because their friends are.

01:36:33.994 --> 01:36:35.996
If one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

01:36:36.163 --> 01:36:37.197
Don't you get that?
I am not going back...

01:36:37.364 --> 01:36:39.933
...to the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

01:36:40.934 --> 01:36:42.302
Holy shit.

01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.440
What is wrong with you?

01:36:46.507 --> 01:36:47.908
Did you like being nobody?

01:36:48.175 --> 01:36:49.843
Do you wanna go back to that?

01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:51.345
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:36:51.512 --> 01:36:52.779
That was the act of a child...

01:36:52.946 --> 01:36:54.281
...certainly not the act of a friend.

01:36:54.448 --> 01:36:56.950
You know how embarrassing it was
for me to try to cash a check today?

01:36:57.017 --> 01:36:58.452
I am not going back to that life.

01:36:58.519 --> 01:37:00.721
- Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah!

01:37:00.988 --> 01:37:03.290
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.792
But I am willing to let
bygones be bygones...

01:37:05.959 --> 01:37:08.195
...because, Wardo,
I've got some good news.

01:37:08.362 --> 01:37:09.463
I'm sorry.

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:14.301
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

01:37:14.468 --> 01:37:17.271
Wardo,
I said I've got some good news.

01:37:17.904 --> 01:37:18.639
What is it?

01:37:18.805 --> 01:37:21.475
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of half a million dollars.

01:37:21.642 --> 01:37:22.709
What?

01:37:22.876 --> 01:37:26.780
Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.

01:37:27.114 --> 01:37:29.583
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

01:37:30.150 --> 01:37:31.485
They need your signature
on some documents...

01:37:31.552 --> 01:37:33.955
...so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

01:37:34.001 --> 01:37:35.034
I need my CFO.

01:37:40.794 --> 01:37:41.828
I'm on my way.

01:37:41.895 --> 01:37:43.363
- Wardo?
- Yeah?

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:44.998
We did it.

01:37:48.135 --> 01:37:49.336
Wardo?

01:37:50.137 --> 01:37:52.005
You're going back there already?

01:37:52.072 --> 01:37:53.207
Yes.

01:37:55.042 --> 01:37:57.211
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

01:38:01.048 --> 01:38:02.850
Somebody stop her!

01:38:05.285 --> 01:38:06.353
Four documents.

01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.255
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements...

01:38:08.322 --> 01:38:11.325
...allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook...

01:38:11.592 --> 01:38:14.928
...as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

01:38:15.195 --> 01:38:16.330
The third is an exchange agreement...

01:38:16.397 --> 01:38:19.032
...allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares...

01:38:19.299 --> 01:38:21.435
...and then finally a voter holding
agreement.

01:38:21.602 --> 01:38:23.270
How many shares of stock will I own?

01:38:23.437 --> 01:38:25.706
One million three hundred
and twenty-eight thousand...

01:38:25.873 --> 01:38:27.975
- ...three hundred and thirty- four.
- Jesus Christ.

01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:31.044
That represents
a 34.4 percent ownership share.

01:38:31.545 --> 01:38:33.814
Why the increase
from the original 30 percent?

01:38:33.981 --> 01:38:36.717
Because you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

01:38:37.417 --> 01:38:39.620
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

01:38:39.686 --> 01:38:40.821
- Economics.
- Right.

01:38:40.988 --> 01:38:45.792
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

01:38:47.094 --> 01:38:50.330
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

01:38:52.399 --> 01:38:54.968
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81 percent.

01:38:55.235 --> 01:38:58.038
Sean Parker, 6.47 percent.

01:38:59.873 --> 01:39:00.708
I can live with that.

01:39:00.774 --> 01:39:02.776
And Peter Thiel, 7 percent.

01:39:06.547 --> 01:39:09.150
Would you like to use my pen?

01:39:09.783 --> 01:39:12.753
Eduardo? Eduardo?

01:39:14.488 --> 01:39:15.589
Can you repeat the question?

01:39:15.756 --> 01:39:17.824
No, it was outrageously leading
the first time.

01:39:17.991 --> 01:39:18.892
You want us to hear it twice?

01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:20.761
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

01:39:21.228 --> 01:39:22.262
Well, go ahead.

01:39:22.329 --> 01:39:24.131
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents...

01:39:24.298 --> 01:39:26.800
...were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?'"

01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:28.235
No.

01:39:32.439 --> 01:39:36.510
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

01:39:36.677 --> 01:39:39.813
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

01:39:43.083 --> 01:39:44.651
I was your only friend.

01:39:46.587 --> 01:39:47.921
You had one friend.

01:39:52.492 --> 01:39:53.760
My father won't even look at me.

01:39:53.927 --> 01:39:56.730
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg
say anything to you...

01:39:56.797 --> 01:39:58.799
...after you signed the papers?

01:39:59.066 --> 01:40:02.069
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

01:40:03.237 --> 01:40:04.605
He'd already told me
that he wouldn't be...

01:40:04.672 --> 01:40:07.808
...coming back to school
for at least a semester...

01:40:07.975 --> 01:40:10.677
...so we were saying goodbye
for a while.

01:40:11.478 --> 01:40:12.679
And then before I left he said,

01:40:12.846 --> 01:40:14.014
But you gotta come back.

01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:16.383
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:18.986
Peter wants to throw us a party
when we hit a million members.

01:40:19.152 --> 01:40:20.988
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back.

01:40:21.055 --> 01:40:23.290
- A million members?
- Yeah.

01:40:23.991 --> 01:40:27.261
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

01:40:28.195 --> 01:40:29.396
Yeah.

01:40:32.833 --> 01:40:34.067
Yeah, I'll be here.

01:40:39.239 --> 01:40:40.274
You sure about this?

01:40:40.441 --> 01:40:41.441
You're 20 minutes late.

01:40:41.675 --> 01:40:42.403
You're gonna walk in there...

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.220
and say you overslept and
didn't have time to get dressed.

01:40:44.445 --> 01:40:46.713
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.415
They're gonna beg you
to take their money.

01:40:48.482 --> 01:40:49.950
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod...

01:40:50.217 --> 01:40:53.187
...and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?

01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:54.688
No, not Roth. Manningham.

01:40:54.855 --> 01:40:57.291
Which one of you is Mitchell
Manningham?" And he'll say, "I am."

01:40:57.350 --> 01:41:00.302
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you.'"

01:41:01.028 --> 01:41:02.329
Walk out.

01:41:02.496 --> 01:41:03.664
Okay.

01:41:16.410 --> 01:41:18.479
In late November,
I got the e-mail from Mark...

01:41:18.525 --> 01:41:20.728
...telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

01:41:20.814 --> 01:41:22.149
What else did the e-mail say?

01:41:22.416 --> 01:41:24.418
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

01:41:25.419 --> 01:41:28.755
That Mark and Sean had played some
kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity...

01:41:29.423 --> 01:41:30.858
...and that Manningham
was so impressed...

01:41:30.925 --> 01:41:34.728
...that he was now making an investment
offer that was hard to turn down.

01:41:35.195 --> 01:41:39.266
So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.

01:41:39.433 --> 01:41:43.070
I didn't know whether to dress for
the party or for the business meeting...

01:41:43.137 --> 01:41:44.672
...so I kind of dressed for both.

01:41:46.273 --> 01:41:48.308
- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?

01:41:48.375 --> 01:41:50.477
Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.

01:41:50.644 --> 01:41:52.212
What were you called out there for?

01:41:56.049 --> 01:41:57.417
An ambush.

01:41:57.818 --> 01:41:59.753
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.794
Hey, man.

01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:09.196
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:42:09.363 --> 01:42:11.698
- Good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

01:42:11.865 --> 01:42:15.302
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

01:42:19.673 --> 01:42:21.475
But then I started reading.

01:42:24.845 --> 01:42:26.647
Wait, what is this?

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:30.184
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:31.385
What is this?

01:42:43.697 --> 01:42:45.165
Mr. Saverin.

01:42:47.801 --> 01:42:48.969
Mark!

01:42:50.237 --> 01:42:51.572
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:52.700
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:54.034
- Is he?
- Yes.

01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:58.079
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

01:42:58.146 --> 01:43:00.447
You issued 24 million new shares
of stock!

01:43:01.849 --> 01:43:03.217
You were told that if new investors...

01:43:03.384 --> 01:43:06.453
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:09.324
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

01:43:11.024 --> 01:43:11.859
It wasn't.

01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:14.962
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership
share diluted down to?

01:43:15.729 --> 01:43:16.529
It wasn't.

01:43:16.564 --> 01:43:19.400
What was Sean Parker's ownership
share diluted down to?

01:43:20.067 --> 01:43:20.901
It wasn't.

01:43:21.068 --> 01:43:23.771
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:24.037 --> 01:43:24.972
It wasn't.

01:43:25.039 --> 01:43:27.975
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

01:43:29.176 --> 01:43:31.845
Point zero three percent.

01:43:39.486 --> 01:43:41.822
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

01:43:42.089 --> 01:43:44.558
You're gonna blame me because you
were the business head...

01:43:44.725 --> 01:43:46.527
...and you made a bad business deal?

01:43:46.593 --> 01:43:48.262
It's gonna be like
I'm not a part of Facebook.

01:43:48.329 --> 01:43:50.564
It won't be like you're not a part
of Facebook. You're not.

01:43:50.651 --> 01:43:53.053
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:54.435
This because I froze the account?

01:43:54.502 --> 01:43:56.704
You think we were gonna let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits...

01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:58.238
...pretending you were running
this company?

01:43:58.405 --> 01:44:00.440
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

01:44:00.607 --> 01:44:04.912
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douche bag!

01:44:05.078 --> 01:44:06.180
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:09.183
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

01:44:09.816 --> 01:44:11.919
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

01:44:14.421 --> 01:44:18.492
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

01:44:18.659 --> 01:44:20.827
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

01:44:20.894 --> 01:44:23.764
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- What the hell's the chicken?

01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:25.566
And I'll bet what you hated the most...

01:44:25.732 --> 01:44:29.502
...is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:32.339
Which I am.
You better lawyer up, asshole.

01:44:32.506 --> 01:44:37.610
Because I'm not coming back for 30
percent. I'm coming back for everything.

01:44:43.483 --> 01:44:46.153
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

01:44:48.522 --> 01:44:49.590
Hang on.

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:53.468
Almost forgot.

01:44:54.628 --> 01:44:56.897
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

01:44:56.964 --> 01:44:58.465
I drew it on the account you froze.

01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:06.306
I like standing next to you, Sean.

01:45:07.541 --> 01:45:09.676
It makes me look so tough.

01:45:22.823 --> 01:45:24.124
Well...

01:45:24.591 --> 01:45:27.261
That's it,
that's our show for tonight, people.

01:45:27.628 --> 01:45:29.930
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:32.292
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

01:45:32.299 --> 01:45:34.969
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

01:45:38.605 --> 01:45:40.474
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:45:41.642 --> 01:45:43.043
You were kind of rough on him.

01:45:43.210 --> 01:45:45.179
That's life in the NFL.

01:45:45.379 --> 01:45:47.114
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

01:45:47.281 --> 01:45:49.083
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

01:45:50.551 --> 01:45:52.619
You didn't have to be
that rough on him.

01:45:52.686 --> 01:45:53.854
He almost killed it.

01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:57.991
I'll send flowers.

01:45:59.626 --> 01:46:03.998
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a
party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

01:46:04.464 --> 01:46:05.632
Ashleigh's a sister.

01:46:05.899 --> 01:46:07.334
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

01:46:07.501 --> 01:46:10.737
Yeah. I know who she is.
Are you guys...?

01:46:11.271 --> 01:46:12.873
Ashleigh? Me? No.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.374
Well, a little bit.

01:46:15.542 --> 01:46:16.376
Why?

01:46:16.543 --> 01:46:18.278
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

01:46:18.345 --> 01:46:21.548
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

01:46:22.316 --> 01:46:24.484
Thanks. I appreciate that.

01:46:25.485 --> 01:46:26.520
These came in for you.

01:46:26.687 --> 01:46:28.455
Put them on my desk.

01:46:35.295 --> 01:46:36.763
What's the package?

01:46:37.598 --> 01:46:38.632
Nothing.

01:46:41.168 --> 01:46:42.636
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

01:46:42.703 --> 01:46:43.937
Refresh.

01:46:44.838 --> 01:46:45.939
Sweet!

01:46:51.745 --> 01:46:53.514
And you're not a hugger.

01:46:54.081 --> 01:46:55.382
I know.

01:46:57.918 --> 01:46:59.386
One million!

01:47:01.154 --> 01:47:03.924
Who's got champagne?

01:47:05.058 --> 01:47:06.827
I've got champagne.

01:47:26.713 --> 01:47:30.250
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

01:47:30.417 --> 01:47:33.420
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

01:47:33.587 --> 01:47:36.490
It is the true digitalization of real life.

01:47:36.657 --> 01:47:39.059
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

01:47:39.226 --> 01:47:41.027
You don't just go to a party anymore.

01:47:41.194 --> 01:47:42.629
You go to a party
with a digital camera...

01:47:42.796 --> 01:47:44.931
...and then your friends relive
the party online.

01:47:45.098 --> 01:47:46.233
And tagging. The idea...

01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:49.569
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

01:47:57.244 --> 01:47:59.613
All right, shut the music down!

01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.582
The party's over!

01:48:01.748 --> 01:48:03.483
Everybody, go home!

01:48:04.084 --> 01:48:06.419
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

01:48:06.686 --> 01:48:08.186
How they check
their friends' status updates.

01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:09.656
Wait. That's weird.
Why did the music stop?

01:48:09.723 --> 01:48:12.793
Check to see which one of their friends
changed their profiles.

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.461
Seriously,
what happened to the music?

01:48:14.528 --> 01:48:16.530
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities...

01:48:16.697 --> 01:48:18.565
...and now we're going to live
on the Internet!

01:48:18.632 --> 01:48:22.236
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

01:48:31.311 --> 01:48:34.047
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

01:48:34.214 --> 01:48:37.417
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

01:48:37.751 --> 01:48:39.586
Then it's all good.

01:48:41.355 --> 01:48:42.389
- It's the cops.
- What?

01:48:42.556 --> 01:48:43.657
Shit! Shit.

01:48:43.824 --> 01:48:47.394
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

01:48:47.928 --> 01:48:50.197
Good to see you, officer.
What can I do for you?

01:48:51.831 --> 01:48:52.632
What's going on?

01:48:52.899 --> 01:48:55.202
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

01:48:55.269 --> 01:48:56.803
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:59.540
I can tell them to turn the music down.

01:49:03.543 --> 01:49:04.611
That's not mine.

01:49:04.912 --> 01:49:07.881
We're gonna need identification. Keep
your hands where we can see them.

01:49:08.048 --> 01:49:09.383
Oh, my God.

01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:11.185
You got anything else in your pockets?

01:49:11.351 --> 01:49:12.386
No, sir. No.

01:49:12.453 --> 01:49:14.588
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:21.261
What's this?

01:49:21.495 --> 01:49:23.197
That's an EpiPen.

01:49:24.264 --> 01:49:26.600
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

01:49:27.634 --> 01:49:29.302
How old are you?

01:49:29.703 --> 01:49:31.104
Twenty-one.

01:49:31.538 --> 01:49:32.573
Twenty-one.

01:49:32.739 --> 01:49:34.074
- Twenty- one.
- I'm 21.

01:49:34.241 --> 01:49:35.876
Lying only makes it worse.

01:49:37.244 --> 01:49:39.746
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

01:49:51.124 --> 01:49:51.858
Hello.

01:49:51.925 --> 01:49:54.494
Listen, something's happened.

01:50:01.935 --> 01:50:02.835
Shit.

01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:04.705
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

01:50:04.872 --> 01:50:08.909
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing
anything. I mean, I've got allergies.

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:14.715
Interns.

01:50:14.781 --> 01:50:16.683
It was just a party.

01:50:19.386 --> 01:50:22.856
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

01:50:24.424 --> 01:50:25.124
I know.

01:50:25.125 --> 01:50:26.693
You know with an intern...

01:50:26.994 --> 01:50:29.062
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

01:50:29.329 --> 01:50:30.831
I will get it under control.

01:50:30.998 --> 01:50:33.300
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

01:50:33.467 --> 01:50:34.968
But this is gonna be news now.

01:50:35.702 --> 01:50:37.972
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

01:50:38.438 --> 01:50:40.007
- I mean, do you think...
- No.

01:50:40.607 --> 01:50:42.543
Or Manningham. One of them.

01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:45.879
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

01:50:46.046 --> 01:50:47.948
You believe me.
God, this is gonna be fine.

01:50:52.650 --> 01:50:53.551
Right?

01:50:56.657 --> 01:50:58.225
Go home, Sean.

01:51:13.473 --> 01:51:14.675
Mark?

01:51:16.843 --> 01:51:17.944
Mark.

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:21.601
We're done for the day.

01:51:21.815 --> 01:51:24.651
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

01:51:28.155 --> 01:51:30.057
What happened to Sean?

01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:32.826
He still owns 7 percent
of the company.

01:51:36.997 --> 01:51:40.801
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

01:51:41.268 --> 01:51:42.569
I can't.

01:51:50.244 --> 01:51:51.445
I'm not a bad guy.

01:51:51.912 --> 01:51:52.980
I know that.

01:51:53.547 --> 01:51:57.217
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85 percent of it is exaggeration.

01:51:57.484 --> 01:51:58.685
And the other 15?

01:51:58.752 --> 01:52:01.855
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

01:52:05.526 --> 01:52:06.860
What happens now?

01:52:08.028 --> 01:52:12.232
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

01:52:12.733 --> 01:52:14.168
Then they'll come back up
to the office...

01:52:14.335 --> 01:52:17.338
...and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

01:52:17.704 --> 01:52:19.573
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

01:52:20.207 --> 01:52:22.810
- And you're gonna have to pay extra.
- Why?

01:52:22.977 --> 01:52:25.245
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

01:52:25.412 --> 01:52:28.382
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:31.636
- I invented Facebook.
- I'm talking about a jury.

01:52:32.119 --> 01:52:34.655
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

01:52:34.821 --> 01:52:37.124
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

01:52:37.291 --> 01:52:39.693
Clothes, hair, speaking style,
likeability.

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.894
Likeability.

01:52:41.061 --> 01:52:44.130
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months...

01:52:44.197 --> 01:52:45.366
...and I could get a jury to believe...

01:52:45.432 --> 01:52:47.901
...that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

01:52:48.268 --> 01:52:49.303
Watch what else.

01:52:49.803 --> 01:52:51.905
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

01:52:52.639 --> 01:52:54.808
- You think I called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

01:52:54.975 --> 01:52:57.044
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

01:52:57.211 --> 01:52:59.246
You've lost your jury
in the first 10 minutes.

01:53:00.914 --> 01:53:01.982
Farm animals.

01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:03.283
Yeah.

01:53:04.284 --> 01:53:06.887
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

01:53:06.954 --> 01:53:09.156
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

01:53:10.290 --> 01:53:11.625
Pay them.

01:53:11.925 --> 01:53:13.126
In the scheme of things...

01:53:13.594 --> 01:53:14.928
...it's a speeding ticket.

01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:19.066
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

01:53:19.333 --> 01:53:21.969
Do you think anybody would mind if
I stayed and used the computer?

01:53:22.136 --> 01:53:24.972
- I can't imagine it would be a problem.
- Thanks.

01:53:26.106 --> 01:53:28.442
I appreciate your help today.

01:53:32.279 --> 01:53:34.515
You're not an asshole, Mark.

01:53:35.782 --> 01:53:38.285
You're just trying so hard to be.
